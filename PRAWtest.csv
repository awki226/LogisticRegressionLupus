0,3,"So long story short, a GI was the first MD to suspect auto immune and then test for it. However, I'm not entirely sure it isn't drug induced and although they have ruled out RA the GI is now pushing things toward ""auto immune hepatitis""

Now, that could be. However a lot of the symptoms started well before anything that could link with AIH and frankly the liver enzyme numbers are not that wild (and a bunch of major symptoms missing but of course, symptoms missing for SLE as well like never had a rash)

Anyway, they seem to be preparing to immediately start medication following biopsy results. They have bloodwork to make sure azathioprine wont go south on me lined up.

My question is, I'd like a second opinion but its taken over a year to get this far, 


1.)how would one even rule out drug induce lupus? (my GI is an asshole and literally walked out of the room without answering my questions, he was pissed I had them and told me I probably had AIH and not to google it and the medicine would probably help after a few years)

2.) if azathioprine is started will it mess up the labs so that ruling out drug induced lupus wont even be possible?

Dr. Michelle Petri at Johns Hopkins has one of the largest lupus clinics in the world and studies her patients very very closely. She showed no increase #lupus flares after #COVID19  vaccine (228 patients) and lupus infections (31 patients tested). Anticardiolipin antibodies did increase after infection. 

Interestingly skin lupus (cutaneous lupus) tended to improve after infection.

However, antiphospholipid antibodies overall did not increase. This is important, as we know COVID infection can cause deadly blood clots (so not surprising). 

Overall, good news for lupus patients.

I‚Äôve been having this sharp pain happening on the left side of my chest, it‚Äôs internal. Every time I inhale there will be a sharp pain, and I have to take short, shallow breaths until it goes away. It lasts only minutes. It is a reoccurring thing.

This occurred today during work, it was a sharp pain but it was a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù one (lasted 30 secs to 1 minute). Unlike last nights where it lasted 2-3 minutes, I‚Äôve had some that have lasted longer.

I have experienced this since I was little. I remember once when I was in the cafeteria in elementary school, it happened to the point where I almost couldn‚Äôt breath in at all and I had to take very short breaths. It happened often when I was young, but not daily. Maybe every other week. 

Another time it was bad was when I was 5 or 6, I was laying in bed one night. Out of nowhere it flared up, I couldn‚Äôt inhale deeply or even breath in normally. Every time I took a breath it was painful, it eventually went away but it left me a little sore. 

Now (I‚Äôm 20), it‚Äôs been happening every day for about a week. Sometimes twice a day.

It almost looks like vitiligo or guttate hypomelanosis, but the white patches are larger in diameter than what is typically seen in guttate hypomelanosis. The package insert for HCQ says that ""pigmentation disorders"" may occur with plaquenil - thus the reason I suspect that plaquenil is playing a role here.

>J Lear and R G Daniels have reportedmuscle cramps related to corticosteroid treament.'In the past 40 months I have seen 55 patients withthe nephrotic syndrome due to minimal changeglomerulopathy. Forty five (36 of whom werefemale) were adults aged over 15. I have treatedthese patients with prednisolone 1 mg/kg andsymptomatic treatment (salt restriction anddiuretics) as required. The patients took this dosage of prednisolone for four to eight weeks,depending on their response and the occurrence ofside effects, before starting to taper the dose.During this period one of the nine men and 30 ofthe 36 women complained of muscle cramps,which were sometimes severe and incapacitating.Initially I thought that this could be related tosalt restriction and the use of diuretics withconsequent electrolyte imbalances. **The meanserum sodium concentration (over the first fourto eight weeks), however, was 136 mmol/ (range133-146 mmol/l) in the men and 133 mmolll(130-144 mmolIl) in the women. The corre-sponding cconcentrations were4 4 mmolIl (3-6-5-0 mmolIl) and 4-5 mmol/l(3 5-4 8 mmol/l) respectively. All the patients hadnormal serum calcium (corrected for albumin) andmagnesium concentrations**.A reduction in the dose ofdiuretic and liberalisa-tion of salt intake had no apparent effect on themuscle cramps. I used quinine empirically (dose300 mg twice daily) in 11 of the 36 women, withcomplete or partial relief of the muscle cramps;these recurred promptly, however, when I stoppedthe quinine for fear of side effects. The crampsresolved as the dose of prednisolone dropped toless than 10 mg daily.Lear and Daniels's patients developed musclecramps while taking either salbutamol or predniso-lone. The common factor between these two drugsis their ability to induce hypokalaemia.

125,21,"I'm recently diagnosed with Lupus and APS and trying to see all the right specialists to get on top of the various problems.

It is a particular type of dizziness here's my best shot at describing it:

* I don't feel lightheaded or like I'm going to black out. No vision changes
* It doesn't feel like the sort of dizziness that comes with nausea. 
* I've had orthostatic hypotension in the past and this feels qualitatively different. Doesn't feel like low blood pressure. 
* I don't feel like I am off balance *from within*. Rather, it just feels like the floor is sinking. (I mean, obviously it is from within, it's not the damn floor. lol But the qualitative sensation makes it feel like it's the floor that is moving.

127,3,"You may have heard that good posture is essential for good health, but do you know why? Posture refers to how you position your body when you‚Äôre sitting, standing, or lying down. Your posture is the result of habits formed over the course of years.

Many people may recognize poor posture in others without realizing how their own falls short. If you look around at co-workers at the office, you‚Äôll likely find them hunched over at their desks. Learn why good posture matters ‚Äî and what you can do to improve yours.

What is good posture?
Good posture is the proper alignment of your body when standing or sitting. Correct positioning involves training yourself to hold your body against gravity with the least strain and tension on supportive structures, such as your muscles and ligaments. Proper posture keeps your bones and joints in optimal alignment and decreases wear and tear on supportive structures.

Good posture reduces back and neck pain
The proper alignment of your spine allows you to move easily so that your body supports your weight without strain. Poor posture can place stress on your tendons, muscles, and ligaments, leading to neck and back pain.

If you suffer from neck and back pain, it may surprise you to know that improving your posture may go a long way in easing your symptoms.

Poor posture impacts digestion
Slouching puts your body in an unnatural position that can impact certain abdominal organs. Stooping or hunching over at your desk or slouching while looking at your mobile device can interfere with proper digestion, increasing the risk for acid reflux and constipation.

If you notice that you get heartburn when slouching, something as simple as sitting up straight may bring relief.

Good posture improves muscle and joint function
When you use good posture, your muscles and other structures function properly, helping you to avoid abnormal wear and tear. Improper posture places stress on your joints and can cause them to wear away. This is the most common cause of osteoarthritis, a form of ‚Äúwear and tear‚Äù arthritis.

While other factors, such as age and genetics, can increase the risk of arthritis, the way you carry your body plays a role in how much stress you put on your joints. Keeping your body aligned in the proper posture can reduce muscle fatigue and strain and help keep your joints healthy and lubricated.

Proper posture boosts mood
When you think about factors that can improve your mood, posture likely isn‚Äôt the first thing to come to mind. Look at it this way: Your brain and body have two-way communication, meaning that your mood can impact your posture and your posture can affect your mood. When you‚Äôre happy, you may notice that you sit upright, and when you‚Äôre feeling down, you‚Äôre more likely to slouch or sit in a slumped position.

The next time you notice your mood sinking, try changing your posture; stand up straight, and take deep breaths. You may notice a gentle boost in mood after doing so.

Proper posture improves spine health
Good posture is one of the simplest and easiest ways to keep your spine healthy. While it may take some practice and mindfulness, using correct posture will provide the appropriate back support. This is especially important if you spend time sitting in an office chair or standing throughout the day.

Sitting and standing with proper alignment improves blood flow, helps keep your nerves and blood vessels healthy, and supports your muscles, ligaments, and tendons. People who make a habit of using correct posture are less likely to experience related back and neck pain.

I don't know what to do.

For months I have been taking 8 mg Methylprednisolone, joint and muscle pain have gone.

In the middle of august I started taking HCQ 400, and after a month I got severe pain in my lower abdomen, pelvis,  scrotum, inner thigh (specially right side), my tummy was bloating. They pain could disappear in one place but start in another (for example after abdomen the pain could appear in right inner thigh). Also it is painful when you masturbate or after that.

[Usually pain in these red areas but could be in different places within boundaries of red border](https://preview.redd.it/lip3lyec9lv71.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=b72fb50fd3ea50c5901935d2870a225c98b96203)

The pain was so intense, painkillers and antispasmodics don't work, 3 times I visited ER in 3 different hospitals, 3 times they did a ultrasound and x-ray but couldn't find anything. CT of the genitourinary system didn't show anything either.

Because of that, I stopped taking HCQ and despite that, the pain come and go for more that 2 weeks I guess.

My rheumatologist asked me to make MRI, colonoscopy and keep taking HCQ but 200.

Because I feel myself relatively fine, 4 days ago I began taking HCQ. The severe abdomen and pelvis pain went back. One day it was kind mild but today it stoke with full force.

136,27,"I (25f) was diagnosed with Lupus a little over six months ago. Aside from the muscle aches and pains, one of my most prolific symptoms was hair loss. 
I've always had very thick, bushy hair so losing it didn't feel like a problem for the longest time because it wasn't making a difference to the total amount of hair I had. I've never cared all that much about my hair and historically maybe don't take the best care of and certainly let it tangle. 
Lately however it's been tangling so much, despite increased hair care, and has become so brittle that untangling it results in chunks coming out. The last few weeks has been causing me so much anxiety as I wash my hair and come back with fistfuls of hair. I spent a week giving it a lot of extra time and effort and finally went to get a haircut yesterday.
The last time I got it cut (the only other time since my diagnosis) the stylist was somewhat hostile and seemed convinced that I butched a quarantine haircut I didn't want to own up to so when I had to embarrassingly say it was a medical condition that was causing the missing hair, she wouldn't believe me. I did not even like the haircut and left feeling pretty bad. 
Fast forward to yesterday and I REALLY didn't want to deal with something like that again so was dreading the haircut so much, but it was either chop it to a more manageable length or slowly pull all of my hair out.
Here comes the uplifting part because the woman who cut my hair was SO kind and careful. I had brushed out my hair that morning but there were definitely still a few tangles at the dying ends that she so slowly and gently brushed out with a comb. When she saw the particularly bad section of my hair, she didn't say anything and accepted when I simply said it was a medication side effect (white lie). She just worked with me to ask what I wanted to do and make sure I was olay with the cut she had to do for it. She really took her time, despite it being a busy day, and was just so kind about everything. I go to a discount chain hair cut place so it's not like I was dropping 50 bucks on this cut but she was treating me better than the times I have gone to a fancy salon. 
I honestly left feeling so much better, fighting back happy tears from the small kindness she paid me. She probably didn't even know how much it meant to me but I'm just still so happy and my hair feels so much better. <3",General,1

Social media was FINALLY enjoyable for me as well as an outlet for all of my suffering with lupus. I actually still text and stay in contact with some of the warriors on my personal page.

A few months ago someone stole one of my lupus posts and she would not take it down. A fellow lupus warrior and friend of mine is the one who pointed it out to me. It took relentless communication for her to finally take it down (I submitted a claim or whatever to make Instagram take it down, told her this, and then she finally took it down). Anyway - it might not sound like much to people or a big deal but I was broken after that and shut down my page. The girl who stole my picture has over 10k followers did not tag me or anything. I know stuff like this happens all the time but I felt violated when it was a picture of me getting an infusion and her claiming she didn't know who sent it to her?!

It put a bad taste in my mouth and now I am so nervous to go back to the community and be reminded that this could happen anytime. I honestly do not think I will be going back anytime soon, sadly enough.

I got a call from my rheumatologist today with more bad news from recent blood work. My inflammation is really bad which is impacting my LFTs, joints, kidneys, colon, and brain. We‚Äôve been doing so much imaging and tests all around including a bone density test which shows that my osteoporosis is getting worse. A part of my tooth even cracked off which my rheum said is probably due to the osteoporosis and/or Sjogrens. 

Anyways, with all of this going down I started talking to my husband about where I want to draw the line. I calculated that I spend approximately 1/4th of the year hospitalized in the past 3 years (when the worst flare up I‚Äôve ever had started). This doesn‚Äôt even include doctors‚Äô appointments, scheduled imaging (MRIs, CTs, ultrasound, etc.), infusions, or even blood work. If I had a full time job there is no possible way I‚Äôve be able to do any of this. My veins are also started to get really messed up as every week I‚Äôm poked at least twice. I look like a fucking junkie. 

With all that being said and done, I told my husband that if the cytoxan doesn‚Äôt work and my quality of life continues to diminish that I want out. I want to stop all treatment, stick with pain management, and just succumb to this disease. This ‚Äúquality of life‚Äù isn‚Äôt living and it truly feels like there‚Äôs no coming back from it. I spoke to my pain management doctor as well and asked his opinion (throughout the year we‚Äôve become very close and not only does he know everything about my medical history, but he‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm able to walk for almost 20 minutes, so I trust him more than any other doctor). He said that at the very least to take prednisone and/or Plaquenil (prednisone caused osteoporosis and Plaquenil didn‚Äôt work), so that he could justify prescribing my pain medication and to continue getting evaluated to monitor my health. He understood me not wanting to try more nuclear treatments, but encouraged me to take more mild medication for all my AIs. 

I know I can‚Äôt be the only one out there who feels like they‚Äôve had enough of all the testing, side effects, hospital visits, lack of a decent quality life, and just being tired of this in general knowing that it‚Äôs chronic. Forever. For the foreseeable future, we‚Äôll never be cured. The best we can hope for is remission. So, where do you guys draw the line?

This is purely just stopping treatment, which I understand can very well lead to death, but I am not talking about ending my life by any means.

This is my fourth post to this sub in three days. It will also, very likely, be my fourth post on this sub I completely abandon. I don't know what I need and I don't know what I want. I do, however, know that I am stuck in this nasty cycle of shortness of breath, unabashed terror, worsening chest pain and shortness of breath, self-led research and education, and finally back to unabashed terror. 

I am married with children. My husband is not health literate. Even if I did explain the situation, there is no shared understanding of what our future may look like. My only other form of familial support comes from my maternal grandmother who is battling alzheimers. 

I've never been one for self-pity, in fact, I have always felt so grateful that I received a diagnosis because the alternative means both living with symptoms of a disease and having no answers. It has only been recently that I realized how really unfair this process has been. I hate that my neighbor is a 50 something female who has been an admitted meth addict since the 1980s, obsessively uses tanning beds, smokes a pack-a-day on top of her pot habit, and has only ever needed to see a doctor for the occasional sexually transmitted disease. 

I am 30, sitting here with every symptom of heart failure. I've done everything right. I took the abuse and got diagnosed. I've taken all the drugs, kept on top of my labs and appointments. I joined clinical trials. I have a neat collection of hats and SPF 50 shirts. I obsessively wear sunscreen, I use blue light filters and led lighting. I don't drink, smoke, or do meth. I don't sit too long, I eat fruit, excersie, and have been to church. Why am I still sick? Why is my disease still progressing? 

What I think is the worst about it all is the symptom that isn't really a symptom-- the impending sense of doom. It's so strange, kind of like anxiety that isn't anxious at all. It's like the subconscious knows that your body is dying. I've only had it one other time, way back when my breathing problems first started, presenting as some pretty intense pneumonia. I've been having dreams that accompany the doom. Last week. I had a dream that I was having a heart attack.  I was walking around with chest cramping and breathing difficulties. I had asked my husband to call 911 and he ignored me saying that he was going to run an errand. I was trying to figure out how to get myself to the hospital when I woke up from the dream with some pretty intense muscle cramping in the center of my chest. 

While I am a very big advocate for therapy for other people, I have been neglecting myself. A while ago. I decided this was too much and scheduled an appointment. I still have awhile to wait, but am so glad I finally  committed myself to go. I also have an appointment tomorrow for a CT and results of my echocardiogram.

I have a diagnosis for Lupus and Antiphospholipd syndrome. I have been reading many of the posts in this chat and am confused, i dont sound like any of you. 

History: I started with immune thrombocytopenia and early renal failure at 21. Many hospital trips for under 10k platelets. No other problems until after i had a splenectomy. Then i started having nerve pain(positive EMG), seeing moving dots in my vision ( have not had time for opthamologist yet), kidney failed in jumps( about to start dialysis). I was sick about every three months with something. I have had two heart attacks- in the first one they found a blood clot and performed an angioplasty. I have  stabbing pain and muscle spasms that have gone undiagnosed due to mucle enzymes and electrolyte levels being normal. I am almost always tired( falling asleep while driving/class). Symptoms always ease up when i am not in school/work. When i go back they pick up. I have been on disability for the first time this year and have been to the hospital far less than usual and for less severe things. The second biopsy showed remission, and my c3 and c4 were normal at that point then became low a month later( as i went to the hospital)

Diagnostic testing: 

ANA panel: negative
Thyroid peroxidase antibody: HIgh positive
Lupus anticoagulant: High positive
Anticardiolipin antibodies: High (IgM, IgA, IgG)
Betaglycoprotein antibodies: High (IgM, IgG)
C3/C4/Ch50 complement: Low
Hemoglobin/hematocrit: low
WBC: always high

Meds:
Hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, atorvastatin, hydralazine, carvedilol, selegiline, tofranil, aspirin 81mg, xarelto, clonidine, Losartan, 

Couldnt tolerate prednisone, dexamethasone, mycophenolate due to too many side effects.


Curiosities: I have no skin rashes, lesions, nor bumps of any kind. My endocrine panel is normal, i dont have photophobia nor alopecia nor do i have reynauds. I am a 27yr old male, and read that 9/10 lupus pts are female, and 98% have positive ANA. I wouldnt bet on me matching either of those categories. 


My doctors have run with the idea of lupus, but like many of you many of the rheumatologists ive met have been extremely skeptical but have not taken the diagnosis.

Fast forward two weeks (two days ago), and I took my 3rd injection. Today I started feeling flushed mid afternoon again. About an hour ago I started to feel dizzy. Took BP and it said 140/96. Ten minutes later 155/86. Then 148/86. My ears and neck feel flushed.

I got great news yesterday, hydroxychloroquine is now available in 100 mg, **300 mg**, and **400 mg** tablets. These are generic, not brand.

I have many patients on **300 mg a day** who have to cut them in half and take 1 1/2 tablets of the 200 mg tablets daily. Others take 200 mg alternating with 400 mg every other day. Very inconvenient.

Now: I can RX one 300 mg tablet a day.

Also, if you take two 200 mg tablets daily, you could take one 400 mg tablet (most people prefer taking less pills.

I asked my rheumy about it and he was flummoxed. Said it may be a form of eczema but hadn't seen anything like it. My blood work was pretty normal. I did a round of Prednisone (for the flair up), but the discoloration didn't change; tried cortisone which seemed to help a little. Then just now they disappeared all on their own.

Height: 5'0

Race: White Hispanic (Spain)

Country: USA

No existing medical conditions, no current medications, no drug use, no smoking. Edit: forgot to mention I‚Äôm autistic.

\-Started college Sep 2019; started experiencing heart palpitations. Saw cardiologist, they said my heart looked fine and it was probably anxiety since I go to school in a city which was a big change for me. These have mostly subsided; I went from back then having multiple a day to now having them maybe one or twice a month IF that.

\-March 2020 moved back home for the pandemic; did online school the remainder of that semester, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021.

\-Went through a LOT of very intense trauma August, October, and November 2020, as well as some more smaller things occurring throughout the rest of the winter. This is when I was feeling nauseous, temp dysregulation, anxiety, pretty much every night. Most of these symptoms are a LOT better now, if not disappeared. If I didn't go to sleep early enough, I would be plagued with extreme nausea, whole body shivering/shaking, chills, intense anxiety, that didn't go away for at least an hour if not more.

\-Moved back to college at the end of August 2021 (about a month and a half ago). This was very good for my mental health and I am mentally doing a lot better than I was for the previous year and a half before that; home is not a very happy place for me.

\-I still have temp dysregulation, but those nights upon nights of just feeling physically ill are a thing of the past. Nausea, chills, shivering/shaking are rare. I do still get headaches from time to time though.

\-Lexapro helped my anxiety but made me gain weight, so I switched to Prozac. Both going on and off Lexapro, as well as going on and off of Prozac made those feelings of ""nighttime sickness"" as well as dissociation and anxiety VERY bad. Maybe the worst they've ever been.

\-I am fully vaccinated and have never had COVID.

\-Non-listed hormones are normal; autoimmune panel was normal; thyroid levels are all normal; rest of metabolic panel and CBC are normal.

\-Most recent bloodwork is from an Endocrinology appointment; recommendations from Dr included: Multivitamin w/ iron + birth control for anemia (I have heavy periods off BC); BECAUSE for painful ovulation and cystic acne; anti-inflammatory diet (gluten + dairy free) for elevated CRP and ESR; BECAUSE and/or weight loss for elevated DHEAS; Metformin and/or Wellbutrin or Phentermine for weight loss.

My biggest concern is that she is just treating the symptoms (anemia, inflammation) when they could be related and have a more serious underlying cause.

Please don't give judgement about the starting and stopping of birth control so much; I am aware that in and of itself is not good for me, but my mother kept trying to scare me out of taking it by doing very sketchy research and bombarding me with it until I changed my mind.

If you have any other questions about other labs or anything like that I can look it up and tell you; I have at the very least a CBC for most of the dates listed in the document.",Advice,0

I haven't pushed or advocated very hard because I feel like ""oh it's just lupus"" but at the end of the day, I've had lupus for 10+ years before any of the below  symptoms started. Also, my lupus is getting better, except for a few very specific symptoms 

**So my question:** if you have lupus and THEN got a fibro diagnosis, how did you navigate the journey? How did you get your rheumatologist to listen, and not dismiss that it's lupus? What do they test for if you have fibro symptoms while also having lupus? Do the below symptoms sound similar to fibro? 

STORY:

In 2016, after several years of remission, I got a c.diff infection that triggered a lupus flare. In 2017, I started dealing with different pain than ever before -- it was also a time that i was HIGHLY stressed (moved across the country, first job out of college, got dumped by my best friend, had relationships issues, my uncle passed away, etc).  

Now in 2021,  the vast majority  of my lupus symptoms (arthritis/ulcers/hair loss/nephritis) have ALL stabilized/almost gone after a year of Benlysta. But I'm still dealing with the below symptoms to no relief. Examples below:

1. Shooting / electric-like pains that migrate all over my body; usually the ""zap"" lasts 30-60 seconds and goes somewhere else. It's not every day, but almost everyday. They are ALL over my body. 
2. When I get over tired, my legs/body are restless + almost like ""crawling out of skin"" feeling. Ex: when laying down on the couch, and my fiance is stroking my arm, after 1 or 2 minutes, my skin feels painful/uncomfortable and i have to tell him to stop touching my arm or touch somewhere else on my body.   
3. I've had chronic left shoulder blade pain for 4+ years; it's aggravated by stress/emotions. I've had multiple scans done + it shows nothing. The pain can be debilitating and even stretches down to my hands/fingers when it's happening. 
   1.  I also have chronic pain in my lower hips/butt night, *only at night*. I'm thinking with the hip pain + shoulder blade pain, it's maybe  the ""tender spots"" mentioned in fibro ?
4. Finally, my **sleep** has been extremely bad for the past year - I always wake up aching and my hips hurt in the middle of the night. I never had this before until the last year or so. Also, my fitbit (which I got in December 2020) shows that I get less than 10% of deep sleep EVERY night for over a year. I have never gotten more than 1 hr of deep sleep for a year. Of course the fitbit could be wrong, but on the RARE occasions when I get 20% deep sleep, I do feel much much better. I've read that non-resortaive sleep is one of the main components of fibro.
5. I have a diagnosis of PTSD from previous trauma, which I know is an overlap with fibro.",Advice,0

269,11,I have allodynia fibromyalgia on top of my lupus. I tolerate it most days but flare ups are excruciating. What caused my flare up today? Getting a pelvic ultrasound. I have been having issues with a sharp pain during sex. Doc ordered an ultrasound and a referral to a GYN. If you've never had a pelvic ultrasound they suck. Not the first time getting one done but they always suck. I got prepared for one this morning by drinking 32oz of water (actually 48 because I drank 2 24oz cups) within the hour before my appointment. My appointment was at 9 so I had to start drinking by 8. I get there and climb up on the table without peeing on myself. 10 minutes into the scan and having the tech pushing down on my bladder she says she can't find my left ovary (it's happened before). So she tells me to partially empty my bladder. Kinda hard to stop yourself when peeing but I managed it. I climbed back up on the table and we started again. 10 minutes later she still can't find my stupid ovary. So she tells me to fully empty my bladder (thank God). After another 10 minutes and pushing the prob down hard she finds my ovary tucked behind my uterus. Test gets over and done with and I leave the office. Few minutes into my drive my flare up starts and my stomach is sore to the touch. I get home and get an email with my results summary. They found a 13mm cyst on my right ovary but nothing else out of the ordinary. My back is tender as well from the table. All that for an inconclusive test. Here it is hours later and 2 hydrocodone and I can't even sit without pain. I'm so over this.,Venting,1

A month later after drinking had pink urine and have had it since after drinking. I don't have any pain related to any type of kidney/bladder pain.


I have spurs in my neck so I have also had neck and arm (shoulder/elbow/wrist) pain. It could be due to a pinched nerve too.

My left elbow developed bursitis (I'm right handed) a little over a month ago out of nowhere. It was getting better and swelled back up a week ago and now is almost back to normal. My PCP prescribed Meloxicam and I think that helped. He also referred me to a osteopath. Also had more bloodwork and it only showed a slight infection which I have been battling a bronchitis with clear mucus so that might be why.


I also have a butterfly rash which I thought was from the heat. It's been super hot this summer and I sweat a lot. Like a lot. But it's just red.

Genuine question: How is it possible to have any level of anti-dsdna and be healthy/not have lupus? 

Background: My mom passed away due to lupus complications in her late 40s. She was in the hospital due to kidney issues and got a MRSA infection that went septic and killed her. 

A few years ago I started having symptoms similar to lupus and other autoimmune diseases, due to my family history, I was able to get into a rheumatologist fairly quickly and got lots of testing done. I had positive RF, antiCCP, and permanent joint damage that showed up on ultrasounds.  I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I also have a family history of RA so that didn't surprise me. Honestly, after watching Lupus take my mom away from me when I was still a teenager, I was relieved to have only have RA because I was so afraid of getting Lupus myself. 

Recently I have been having symptoms that more align with Lupus than RA (and I know it's possible to have both) so I am just curious. I have always tested negative for ANA screen. I have tested 3 times and the most recent time was about a year and a half ago. I was looking at old lab work and I saw that I had a low, but not positive amount of anti-dsdna? My level was 2 and I think the weak positive range starts at 20? I am curious as to how it's possible to have a low amount of antibodies, but not have the actual disease? My thought is that it's like if you have fought an infection previously but it is not active you would still have a low amount of the antibodies for that virus. Would that mean it's possible that I once had a higher level during a flare? I have been told that it's possible that I got that small amount of antibodies from my mom because she had been diagnosed with Lupus long before she got pregnant with me?

Background- I‚Äôm a 35 year old female.

‚Ä¢Chronic migraine 
‚Ä¢ Joint pain that recently progressed from large joints to fingers & toes as well (intermittent) worse on the left side
‚Ä¢Weird patches of dry skin only on the left side 
‚Ä¢I did have a malar rash, it was quite dramatic and I was diagnosed with drug induced lupus. I have subsequently (years later) had my blood tested for chromatin and antihistone antibodies which came back negative 
‚Ä¢I also have pretty extreme heat exhaustion and general fatigue

Now, the cold hands and dull achy pain is happening again and this time I‚Äôm feeling it pretty much throughout my entire body- arms, legs, fingers, wrists, shoulders, but my joints themselves don‚Äôt seem to be swollen.

357,36,"First, a little background. I‚Äôve had AI problems since I was 12. For the past couple of years shit really hit the fan and lupus has made my quality of life decrease significantly. I‚Äôve come to terms with it and even though shit keeps popping up and more procedures and tests have to be done, I‚Äôve accepted it. I‚Äôm not happy about it, but I‚Äôm also not wasting my energy hating everything that‚Äôs going on and being hyper focused on all the bad. 

However, I feel like because things have gotten so bad, I‚Äôve lost some of the sympathy I had for others. 

Since I‚Äôve become diagnosed with fibrosis a couple of years back (and a recent biopsy and fibro scan showed some permanent scarring), I feel like people are drowning themselves in a cup of water if their doctor says to try eating healthier to improve a case of mild NAFLD. I understand they‚Äôre scared and sometimes I‚Äôll explain how the liver is extremely resilient and that they‚Äôll be okay if they listen to their doctor and put in the work. Sometimes it works and people DM me saying everything is back to normal and will thank me for trying to calm them down. However, at the same time, I‚Äôm screaming in my head that it‚Äôs not a big deal and to just eat carefully, maybe lose a couple of pounds if necessary, and your problem will be solved! Some people seriously obsess over ALTs and ASTs in the 40s even when they have no health problems and say how they are going to die young. Like, what??? No doctor would tell you that! 

Sometimes I see posts about people freaking out because they got a ‚Äúweird rash‚Äù (right after having been in the sun all day) and that it *must* be cancer and that it‚Äôs impossible for it to be a simple sun burn. It‚Äôs as if people *want* to get diagnosed with something and are looking for any excuse to find something wrong. 

Then there are those who *have* been diagnosed with mild cases of some acute condition, but swear it means they‚Äôre now and forever disabled. Then they ask how to get handicap passes for parking even if it has nothing to do with their ability to walk, they‚Äôre ability to be in the sun for longer than 5 minutes, or anything that‚Äôs an actual real reason for needing it. No, Karen, having a UTI doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt walk. You might have to take some pain meds and antibiotics at most, but I‚Äôm pretty sure you can walk an extra ten steps instead of parking in handicap. 

My favorites though are the self-diagnosing posts with vague symptoms and no proof. I try to never comment on those because they usually have already made up their mind and can‚Äôt be convinced that without seeing specialists, they do not officially have anything. I‚Äôm talking about the people who *know in their gut* that they are chronically or terminally ill, yet refuse to see a doctor. 

I want to sympathize like I did before, I really do. But after being tested like a guinea pig, having real medical diagnoses, taking medicine that keeps me alive and functioning as much as it can, feeling and having real symptoms (not sun burns or literally a dot on my hand), I just can‚Äôt anymore. I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt have a right to worry because every illness starts somewhere. I‚Äôm saying they need to use common sense. If they went to a concert and screamed all night, the sore throat they have probably isn‚Äôt a death sentence.

About a year ago I started getting weird symptoms. My knees would swell up life grapefruits and my fingers looked like sausages. The joints in my hands and elbows were so stiff that I couldn‚Äôt straighten my arms. Then the fatigue started. I was so tired I couldn‚Äôt cook or eat. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and I went all the way at down to 105lb. Everything I ate bothered my stomach or made things worse. My lymph nodes were so swollen in my boobs chest and neck that they looked like huge grapes under my skin. I got a rash that started INSIDE my fucking ears and spread onto my face. During this time I got divorced (thank god my ex husband is an angel and is still loving and a good friend). The stress of the divorce still made things worse tho.
I started getting recurrent infections and was ok antibiotics for a month and a half straight, that‚Äôs when the light sensitivity started. The day after my 24th birthday I got a horrendous migraine. I literally could move my head. I was in the hospital for a week and they ran all my tests. They diagnosed me with lupus and said it was such a classic case that they had medical students coming into my room to study me which was great for them but annoying as fuck for me. I was in so much pain and so sensitive to light I had to wear shades even at night because the hospital lights were causing excruciating pain. It‚Äôs been a rocky road. My diagnosis was 6 months ago. As I‚Äôm writing this, my eyebrows have fallen out, and I dealt with hair loss. Some natural remedies have worked for the hair loss thank god, but my brows are terrible. I‚Äôm skinny and exhausted, and I live in Houston where being skinny is NOT it. People comment negatively about my weight all the time. 
My neck ears and scalp are covered in a painful itchy rash and I‚Äôm just exhausted, sad and tired of this shit already. I don‚Äôt date anymore right now because aside from
Still needing healing, the stress of my rebound cheating on me (after my divorce) made my symptoms so much worse that I don‚Äôt want to go through that again. I just quit my job bc my boss was NOT sympathetic and didn‚Äôt understand my symptoms at all. Thank god I have student loans. I‚Äôm a PHD student and that‚Äôs the only thing keeping me going rn.

For the last 4 months I have had:
- Quite severe joint pains
- Extreme Fatigue
- Frequent Mouth Ulcers
- Rash Across the face
- Hair Loss 
- Headaches
- Confusion
- Dizziness

I went to my doctor who referred me to a Rhumatologist. He thought it was lupus so he ordered some bloods. My ANA was negative. As were pretty much all the other tests other than my ESR which was very slightly raised at 20. My Rhumatologist told me it couldn't be lupus because my ANA was negative, however other GP's have told me you don't need a positive ANA. I did have some abnormal liver function tests however they have returned to normal and the doctor thinks it may have been due to a medication I was on.

In my family there are a few auto immune conditions. My dad has psoriasis and RA. My cousin has psoriasis and RA. My great grandad had type 1 diabetes and my great grandmother had RA. 

So far none of the doctor's really know what to do with me and just seem to be sending me around to other doctors who also don't know what to do. 

Is it possible that I have lupus???

(Also have a question about blood tests. On multiple websites it says that people with lupus who test negative for ANA commonly test positive for Anti-Ro and Anti-La antibodies. However aren't these a type of ENA? And isn't ENA a type of ANA or am I mistaken. I don't understand how you could test negative for ANA but positive for a type of ENA. I was also supposed to be have an ENA test however I never received the results. I assumed this was because my ANA was negative.)",Advice,0

I've been diagnosed with seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis for a few years. Treated with Prednisone, and now Humira.

They found that I have Immune Complex Glomerulonephritis. My kidneys are inflamed and the Nephrologist said something about antibodies attacking them, and also said there are blood clots in my kidney arteries.

The Nephrologist said it could be Lupus.

I looked up the symptoms and I do feel like a lot of them fit me. But so do a lot of RA symptoms. (And of course I have the high crp and sed rate)

The results showed high ESR & CRP and my Anti-dsDNA was positive and my ANA  titers were Homogenous >1280 and Nuceolar titer >2560, but SSA, SSB, SM/RNP, SM, & SCL-70 were all negative. Also there was a .2 amount of M-protein found.

Had an MRI done to rule out MS which was negative.

I  just completed my first Benlysta pre-filled injection! I've had SLE since 2016 and have been on a plethora of medications. Most recently I was on methotrexate injections which was ROUGH!

Other people want to work from home, but they're not allowed. One of our best managers wanted to work from home for her illness, but she left because management wouldn't let her!

447,50,"After a few years of this diagnosis (with a lifetime to go woo), I realized I've amassed a couple of small tips to deal with the practical aspects of living with this disease. Hopefully they're not too obvious:

1. If you're on hydroxychloroquine, set up large text and text-to-speech reading on your phone in the accessibility settings before you go in for your retinal scans so that you can still read your messages after they dilate your pupils.
2. If you need to file an appeal with your insurance, save the letter in a separate document to reuse next time they give you grief. Also ask for carbon copies of all of your referrals/labs/scans (instead of one doctor just sending them straight to another) and file them on your computer or in an accordion in case one of your referrals/pre-auths \*mysteriously\* goes missing.
3. Drink several glasses of water one hour before your appointment, so that it's perfectly timed for urine samples and your veins are ready for blood draw.
4. Track your symptoms and/or their triggers with an app like Symple and use the export function to create a .CSV for your doctor or yourself to recognize patterns.
5. Plan to get yourself a little treat after every appointment so there's something positive to look forward to when you're feeling anxious. :)

My ears feel full too and moving my head around can be very painful. I noticed some of the other lymph nodes in the area are swollen too and I've been feeling a bit dizzy.

458,6,"I have had lupus since 2014 and managed it pretty well until last year when the pandemic hit. The unknown nature of COVID paired with the constant bickering of my parents caused it to flare up. Background: I moved in with my parents 1 yr (from the US to India) after the diagnosis to manage my condition and live the life I wanted. 

They always had a rocky relationship but they made it work for us children. They'd bicker about each other to me every time because I was just there. They'd involve me in their fights for no reason. Before covid, I could brush it aside, travel, and have other ways to vent my frustration. BTW, we have for years told them to get a divorce but they keep ""postponing"" it. But stuck in a lockdown with compromised immunity meant I couldn't really go anywhere. So in 28 yrs of my life, for the first time, I had a mental breakdown so big I was numb and shaken for days. I was yelling so loudly at 1 am in the morning that I could not even feel the air in my lungs. One great thing that came out of it was I made them KNOW how they have hurt me all my life by not considering my feelings EVER, and that even after knowing about my condition, they continued their circus. Since then I have made it a point they know they cannot think of me as a sounding board or their fucking therapist. 

Now their interactions are mellowed out, and I do not entertain their issues with each other. If, after 30 yrs of marriage, they're still together then they fucking better know they have made peace with how their relationship is and not project that onto others. And the hilarious part is they still have the balls to keep pushing me to get married. After seeing this kind of disaster and having lupus, how in the world do they think they're in a position to say that? 

Adding covid + lupus flare-up to the mix, my emotional well-being has been at the lowest. At first, I couldn't really understand what it was, but through therapy, I understood I was feeling emptiness, unhappiness, and hopelessness. And it kept coming back more frequently which scared me more. And since a few weeks, the frequency of 'I just don't know how I'm going to get through this' increased more and more. Again, I broke down during therapy a few days back because I realized **what I was going through wasn't like me**, and that for me is the scariest thing.

We will no longer be attending family events at their home, as it is not safe for me or him (he also has an autoimmune disease). Along with their shenanigans and all the stress of making so many decisions in such a short period of time, the stress started to get to me. I also suffer from non-epileptic seizures and thought I was handling the stress well because I was not having seizures regularly.

Dermatologist ordered blood work and I had negative ANA and ssb, but positive ssa. She put me on HCQ and tacrolimus ointment and referred me to a rheumatologist. However, before starting HCQ she had me get some baseline labs done. All were normal except my liver and kidney tests came back elevated, but not horribly so. Important to note, for this conversation, that my platelet count was within normal range (146), but just barely.

Two months after starting the HCQ (and my body feeling better than it has in a long time) I finally see the Rheumatologist. We met for over an hour, walking through every symptom and possibility. He felt pretty confident that I had Lupus, but wanted a full work up (like 30+ blood tests, x rays, etc). Everything came back negative including SSA, and the liver and kidney tests which were previously positive. I take that as a sign that HCQ is helping. However, my platelet count is now lower, just barely below normal range at 137.

The rheumatologist is now concerned that there might be a blood disorder involved as well. He wants a hematologist to rule that out before going further with other medications for lupus. Totally understand and I'm fine with that. I have an appointment with a hematologist next week. But I have read that low platelet count can happen with lupus so I'm confused why he seemed especially concerned.

Throughout all this, my malar rash has shown no improvement which the dermatologist was a bit surprised about. And in general, I don't think I feel horrible like I see most people on here talk about.

481,4,"I work as a CNA in a long term care facility, and they will be mandating the flu vaccine (alongside the covid vaccine, which I already have). I normally only got the flu vaccine years ago when I was working as a CNA (got back in the field this year) and I would end up sick afterwards. I understand that the vaccine itself doesn't make anyone sick, but it does have an impact on the immune system. I'm ok with getting the flu shot, but I have some questions. I am waiting to see my regular dr to get a referral to a rheumatologist, so I'm asking here as a starting point.


I was recently diagnosed with discoid lupus, and I have had Hashimoto's thyroiditis for about 13 years.


First, I'm wondering if anyone would want to share their experience with getting the flu vaccine, and what their doctors have recommended. I'm also curious if anyone has or does work in healthcare, and their experience with their facility. For example, have they allowed time off if your doctor recommends a recovery period? Is that a thing? What questions should I ask my doctor? If there is anything else anyone would like to share, I'd love to hear it.

482,5,"Hi everyone. I wanted to share my experience and see if anyone here has had a similar one and if so, find out how you dealt with it. 

I was diagnosed with JRA at the age of 2 and have had joint pain all my life, starting in my knees and spreading to almost every joint, including my fingers, wrists, elbows, TMJ, shoulders, hips, toes, and ankles. I started with just methotrexate early on and quickly progressed to the triple therapy of methotrexate, plaquenil and sulfasalazine, which I‚Äôve been maintaining for a long time. I had unexplained fatigue and muscle pains that I thought were just because of my sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet. 

I am now 26 and was very recently diagnosed with Lupus after switching doctors and having extensive lab work and X-rays done for the first time in years. My flare-ups had been increasing in frequency and severity since the beginning of last year. I‚Äôm now on a steady stream of prednisone that I need to function normally. I was just pre-authorized to start Benlysta, but am concerned about potential side effects. I‚Äôve experienced some mental health problems that were brought on by birth control in the past, so when I see depression as a potential side effect I get pretty wary of it, but at this point I just need to start feeling better. I don‚Äôt want to be on steroids much longer if I can help it. 

So I guess I‚Äôm wondering, who else here has had a similar experience as far as thinking it was one thing for so long and then being turned around so suddenly? What are your experiences with Benlysta? And I‚Äôm extra curious to hear from those who started having symptoms at a very young age and how that affected you growing up and into your twenties.

489,2,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôve been a lurker here for the last few months of my symptoms becoming increasingly more suspicious of lupus, so it‚Äôs gonna be a bit of a long winded post.

I have historically had chronic sinus infections, ear infections and tonsil infections my entire life. I have spent the last ~3 years working on getting a diagnosis for Ankylosing Spondylitis, which finally, after a lot of fighting with lots of different doctors, we determined I do have. I was put on Humira initially and I started getting tonsil infections 2-5 times a month, along with severe eye inflammation where my left eye would swell shut, have a burning/stabbing pain and my vision would go blurry for weeks at a time. Humira also severely messed up my period and caused pseudo PCOS symptoms, so it was a very detrimental medication that I had to come off of, despite it having life changing effects for me as far as mitigating my pain and fatigue 100%. I was then switched to Cosentyx and although it is still helping the AS in my spine, it is doing absolutely nothing for me in regards to my other symptoms. I have such severe fatigue that came back as soon as I discontinued the Humira, to the point of me barely being able to drag myself out of bed, some days.

Anyway! So it has been determined that I for sure have AS, that is fine. All of my bloodwork came back positive for AS. I have always suspected lupus in the back of my mind over the last several years of this journey due to a butterfly rash I get on my face every day that I have had since I was a kid, especially after spending more than 2 minutes in the sun. It gets particularly bad after showers as well. I have been treated for rosacea and given steroids and metronidazole cream to no avail. I‚Äôve also had:
‚Ä¢severe breathing trouble and chronic costochondritis for over a year that flares up periodically and will last months at a time
‚Ä¢photosensitivity all over my body but mainly on my hands, legs, feet and shoulders (and face) after spending more than 2 minutes in the sun
‚Ä¢debilitating joint pain in my toes despite testing negative for rheumatoid
‚Ä¢massive swelling in my hands and feet every day
‚Ä¢left eye blurryness and swelling with stabbing burning pain that happens every month for seemingly no reason other than flaring super badly
‚Ä¢massive amounts of hair loss as well as split ends and dry/brittleness that will happen literally a week after a massive haircut to mitigate split ends

My ANA came back 1:160 fine, speckled and my PCP said I also had a previously positive ANA, but other bloodwork checking for sjorgens(?) and other lupus markers came back negative. I did, however, go in to get those labs drawn when I was feeling pretty good and had very minimal pain. For the last week, I have been in the worst flare I‚Äôve ever experienced with a tonsil infection that has gone down to my neck lymph nodes and Eustachian tube, and I could literally feel my eye stabbing and burning yesterday. I went in to recheck all of my lab work because I literally felt like death yesterday, so I‚Äôm hoping it will yield some more clear results this time. I am curious if all of these symptoms coincide with those of you who have been positively diagnosed with lupus, especially the eye swelling and hurting with blurry vision? These infections regularly afflict me to the point of me going for a tonsillectomy beginning of October, so I am also curious if lupus leaves people vulnerable to these sorts of infections frequently?

490,4,"TL;DR

My C-Reactive protein levels have abruptly gone from high (30-40mg/L) to low (3.1mg/L), but I am still having issues with pericarditis and pleurisy. Why is this? My doctor wants me to take Azathioprine despite the low C-Reactive protein levels, and I'm feeling quite hesitant.  Will the pericarditis and pleurisy resolve without immunosuppressants now that my CRP is down? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry for writing a novel here..Really having some problems figuring out what to do right now. I've had SLE for about a year, and have taken prednisone & hydroxychloroquine since diagnosis. The blood tests this entire time have indicated inflammation, with C-Reactive protein constantly between 30-40 mg/L. There has also been significant inflammation in the heart and lungs, causing pericarditis and pleurisy. I tried methotrexate 3 months ago, but was unable to continue it because my ALT levels were getting quite high.Fast forward to last month.. Switched to a vegan diet in early August, and in mid August I decided to try Azathioprine. 2 weeks after starting the Azathioprine, I have a blood test done with my C-Reactive Protein was 3.1 mg/L. It has never been this low. Two weeks simply doesn't seem like enough time for the azathioprine to be effective. Diet is the only variable that changed in this time, I'm wondering if that can account for the decrease in inflammation.Despite the blood test results, I'm still experiencing pericarditis and pleurisy, although I'm at a much lower dose of Prednisone (15mg) now, compared to before (40mg). I decided to temporarily stop the Azathioprine last weekend due to relatively new severe point-specific & pressure headaches, and heart palpitations. Sunday night, it literally felt like the top of my head was caving in, and that was the last time I took the Azathioprine. I'm not entirely sure if these problems can be linked to Azathioprine, but it was the only variable that changed since these events began taking place.I'm really torn on whether or not I should continue to take the azathioprine, not only because of the potential side effects, but because my inflammation appears to be down. Although, I don't understand why my pericarditis and pleurisy are still prevalent. I'm wondering will the pericarditis and pleurisy resolve with time, or do I absolutely need immunosuppressants?

So here goes, 19 months ago I got a referral to a rheumatologist for joint swelling/pain and a blood test that flagged me for potential RA. 
Finally got my first appointment 2 weeks ago. Was sent for more blood test (including Lupus and Scleroderma) and chest x rays. 

Got the results today and x rays are good, all bloodwork came back good, except it came back positive for lupus (forgive me, I don‚Äôt know any numbers or names for things).

I know the HCQ is working well for me and things are totally more tolerable now but what always does me in is that during those periods where I feel things are great again I tell myself like oh maybe this was all stress/psychosomatic and it's all in my head just for my body to be like ""ha, bitch you thought"" and then I end up entering into a flare (probably from not taking things seriously and pushing myself too far too frequently when feeling ok).

In my routine bloodwork last month, my wbc were 2.4, which is much lower than my usual.

Dad has plaque psoriasis, sister has psoriatic arthritis (no psoriasis patches) they are both negative ANA.

Sister has about the same symptoms as me, but I have some extra.

**Symptoms and info:**   
35/female   
1 child (12 years old)  
 Overweight and gaining because I can‚Äôt even ride on my bike anymore without extreme pain, I can only walk for about 10 minutes before I have to pull my foot up from pain.

Migraines, rash up when I get too hot or am in the sun to long (lasts 5-6 hours after exposure), mouth ulcers often, swollen feet and hands, index finger is swollen and red and sometimes will have a bump on it that becomes VERY itchy and oozes, raynauds in lips, hands and feet, extreme fatigue (after a semi-busy day I catch myself closing my eyes even while driving), neck pain and swelling, massive foot pain (been limping for a few months now), easy bruising (turning my office chair into my desk can leave a bruise lol..)

ANA 1:320 speckled   
CRP - high   
RF - Neg   
Sed rate - normal range   
HLA-B27 - Neg   
LA - tests range was less than or equal to 40, mine was 40.  The rheum is considering this to be positive.
 DRVVT - High   
DRVVT confirm - confirmed  
 DRVVT 1:1 - corrected (have to do more blood work in 12 weeks)
 Vitamin D deficiency  
 C3, C4 - within normal range  
 CREA - low   
ALKP - high   
Everything else liver and kidney wise is within range

**doctor:**  
 specializes in PsA and due to family history believes it‚Äôs probably PsA. She says that since my rash goes away after a few hours (5-6ish) that it‚Äôs probably not lupus related. She also says the ANA doesn‚Äôt matter much because it‚Äôs like saying I have a car, but not the kind of car. It was always my understanding that PsA normally doesn‚Äôt trigger a pos ANA.

She did keep asking about miscarriages, which I told her I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had. I didn‚Äôt realize this was a question related to clotting because I have incredibly heavy periods with large clots, so I wasn‚Äôt able to tell her this at first visit. If I have had miscarriages, I‚Äôve always believed them to be at the cellular level.

My sister, who has PsA, actually thinks it‚Äôs probably lupus.

I‚Äôm unsure if all of the results have come in, but it looks like the results are a mixed bag. My symptoms lean more towards lupus, but could be either or both. My blood work doesn‚Äôt seem to lean towards anything. All I know is that I‚Äôm exhausted and in pain constantly.

520,5,"Hello all -

I've been seeing a rheumatologist recently after my annual bloodwork revealed rheumatoid factor. My bloodwork and symptoms have been inconclusive (negative ANA but positive SM antibody, low levels of vitamin D / B12, otherwise no real symptoms besides fatigue/myalgia) and my doctor diagnosed me with UCTD. My next appointment is just a follow-up in January, she said that if my symptoms worsen she might put me on plaquenil but otherwise for now, it's just monitoring the disease.

I've become severely depressed as of late - the stress of having what feels like an axe hanging over my neck and how it'll impact my future, feeling lonely and without a support network, unemployed (due to reasons) and financial stress. I've been feeling extremely lethargic and tired, and crying every single day. Starting two days ago, for some reason my hands are tingling/numb and I have tenderness/pain in one joint, but otherwise there is no swelling or any color changes. I told my doctor that I've been having joint pain in a finger, but she said that if it's lupus-related I would generally have joint pain in multiple places. I'm very worried because my career is highly specialized and requires use of my hands.

I just feel so overwhelmed and depressed, not knowing whether this is lupus-related or  anxiety/depression-related or both, and I'm worrying that all my worrying might make my symptoms worse. Should I just call my doctor and ask for the plaquenil or am I making things worse by stressing out?

I'm new to the community here and thought I'd introduce myself. I'm a 32 year old female with Lupus. Like many of you, I was misdiagnosed for years, and I mean *years*. One doctor visit to the next, blood work, scans, etc, before it was narrowed down to Lupus. 

For a while now my Lupus has been at bay. With occasional flares that last 3-4 days, sure it's painful, but I don't need to tell you all that. Somehow we get through it and continue on with our daily lives.

But I recently just made it through one of my worst flares yet. Completely bedridden for almost 6 days. My knees felt like someone took a sledgehammer to them, eyelashes and fingernails even hurt. It sounds crazy I know, but I kid you not, the pain was everywhere. I could barely lift my phone because it hurt my wrists and it took all my energy to text friends or family as the pads of my fingertips hurt to touch the phone's keyboard. So to say the least, it was a brutal one.

But I come here wanting to know if anyone else experiences swollen eyes during a flare? Usually I can tell a flare is coming on if one of my eyes starts to get a little puffy. Then typically a few days after, the flare usually hits, and that eye becomes even more swollen. I'm talking it sometimes looks like I've gotten into a bar fight swollen. This last flare was so bad that both my eyes and eyelids became swollen. My right eye so much that I could barely see out of it. 

Just curious if anyone else can relate to this because after this last flare, I seriously had moments of doubt. I didn't see the light at the end of the tunnel like I usually do. There were moments of wanting to give up because the pain was so intense. And now I'm really nervous what my next flare holds as I don't know if I can handle such an intense one again.

After seeing my primary care after that visit, she noted I still had elevated blood pressure (not awful, like 130/85) and protein in my urine. She wrote off the protein due to my blood pressure. My blood pressure regulated pretty soon after but every few months, I get my urine checked and it went down but stays around 33 mg/mol. So slightly abnormal. I also have had costochondritis since having my son along with sciatica stemming from inflammation at my SI joint. 

My OB wanted me to go to a nephrologist before having another kid just to get checked out about the microalbum. The nephrologist said he wanted to check me for lupus just in case. My ANA titer came back 1:80 and pattern nuclear homogeneous. Everything else was normal in urine and blood besides the 33 mg/mol of microalbum. 

I do get the leg pain and rib pain from costochondritis but have wrote that off as my body just changing after a baby and my core being so weak.

I've been feeling bad for years and he wants to make sure it's not a temporary illness lol. I got a recommendation for a new doctor who apparently is very nice and diligent about finding the source of the problem.

I was diagnosed with lupus when I was 13 after I was hospitalized with severe chest pain. And just to be clear, this was a pain I had never experienced and still have difficulty describing. It left me speechless, sleepless, hopeless, and frightened. Every breath I took felt like I was being stabbed by a serial killer. 


Anyways‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt have another flare up until I was 20. And boy oh boy it was a fucking FLARE UP. At first it started with a horrendous chest infection which went away after a week or so. Then I got a double ear infection which led to pneumonia? Yeah.. I know. Autoimmune disorders are fun!!! After that I was diagnosed with mono which left me jobless and bed ridden for weeks. I finally convinced myself (and my parents) that I was sick enough to go to the doctor. Every time I stood up I got dizzy and nauseous, and I barely made it to my appointment. 

The nurses took me back to the room and checked my vitals. My vitals were decent, but once they checked my blood??? All hell broke loose. Within 20 mins I was rushed to the nearest hospital and my anxiety was through the ROOF. 

Once I was in the hospital, the medical staff looked up at ‚ÄúGod‚Äù and then me. Finally I came to my conscious state and the doctor told me, ‚Äúyour kidneys are only functioning at 13%.‚Äù As an ignorant 20 year old, I wasn‚Äôt sure what this meant.

I have a question for all those who have kidney issues (or lupus nephritis) connected to lupus.

I have lupus and some other autoimmune junk going on. Lately we've got everything all sorted out and I feel so much better, like I haven't felt this good in years. I finally have the energy to do things, like go to a powerlifting gym and do strongman stuff.

But I still have bad days, and flare ups, and weird little moments where I'm fighting something stupid my body is doing and I just can't explain it to people who don't have quite as unpredictable bodies.

And my boss at work and my coaches at the gym a lot of times just want to be encouraging and get me pepped up. I know I do struggle sometimes with confidence. I'm not used to being able to do things. I expect my body to give up on me right when I need it. I spent a couple years where I was so weak I couldn't walk without crutches or a cane, and now I'm lifting multiples of my body weight on my shoulders and shit. It's an adjustment!

So what I've been doing is I'll just try to cut off the ""you can do it"" comments if I end up needing to stop for some reason. I want encouragement and I need it, but I also need to listen to my body. I have to find that balance.

So a few times now I've disclosed ""oh see I have lupus and xyz is happening and I need a minute"" but it never goes over well. I just feel awkward as shit (I don't like telling people what's wrong with me) and my coaches take it as even more reason to encourage me when they think I can handle it.

Expected effect = ""oh yeah let's let you rest a minute because you're not BSing me to get out of your work""

Actual effect = awkward silences, ""you can do it"" continues

582,63,"I'm going to start this off by saying I've(26f) never been the type of person to want others pitying me or worrying about me, so when my symptoms first started I ignored them. I brushed it off, myself, as stress and nothing more. My hair started falling out (though it's always been thick so even losing handfuls throughout the days would go unnoticed by everyone but me), my joints had already been hurting consistently since middle school, and I was finding it harder and harder to stay awake. I was struggling to do basic things like my chores. I begged my dad to take me to get it checked out, he said it was probably nothing and to just start going to bed earlier (I was already sleeping 9-10 hours a night). I talked to teachers and the school nurses and they all thought it was growth spurts or me trying to get out of class. Years of various adults would always ignore and dismiss my pleas because ""there's no way a child your age is actually hurting like you claim, so stop faking, so being lazy and grow up. Just do your chores and stop complaining"" (I was about 12 when this was said to me, and it stuck with me because it was said by my own father, so naturally it devastated me)
Once I was old enough to drive myself (and thankfully had a doctor I could go to any time without paying through my father's job at the time) I went to them. They theorized mild arthritis, depression and anxiety (which, duh! I'd been told my whole life that I was overreacting when I had been in constant pain the whole time). I then spoke with my cousin (who is an RN with a step daughter with lupus that also went undiagnosed for so long she went into renal failure before they realized and ended up on chemotherapy for a while but has since recovered and lives a happy full life) about my symptoms. I had spoken to her before but she didn't have the experience with it yet and didn't make the connections back then. She sat with me and finally listened in depth to everything I've gone through and experienced. She suggested I request an ANA test be done. No theories, just that I need to request that specific test. I did and it came back negative so the autoimmune disorder continued to go undiagnosed. I kept up my complaints and research. I kept talking to my cousin as well about it because I finally had someone who listened and understood something really was wrong. Every time my doctor's office would switch professionals(they rotated, as it was technically an on site clinic for the employees and their families at my father's job) I would request that ANA again. It came back negative so many times but I just knew I had to keep asking. I know autoimmune disorders can present even with a negative ANA) I started having neurological symptoms. I'd zone out, lose time, and my anxiety and depression deepened. I felt like I was losing my mind. I brought the loss of time to my newest provider (same office, she was just a newer hire and to this day I believe she is the most professional and most amazing doctor I've ever had) and with that added to my other symptoms and the consistent ANA tests, she decided to try again. This time my ANA was positive and I showed positive for Lyme disease (which, as us lupus warriors know, lupus often causes false positives for Lyme disease). She put me through the mandatory treatment for Lyme disease, just in case, and referred me to a rheumatologist who confirmed I have lupus. A month after my diagnosis (bless that sweet doctor and my new rheumatologist) I found out that the time loss and zoning out was absence seizures, as I ended up in the ER after having a seizure while driving to work. We still haven't figured out if the seizures are actually connected, but I've also been officially diagnosed with epilepsy as well. Needless to say, my father and every adult I maintained contact with that always brushed me off suddenly felt very ashamed for it. 
I guess my point is... if you think you have lupus, no matter how many people doubt you, keep fighting to get the right diagnosis. I've been diagnosed and treated for a year now and, while I still get flare ups during especially stressful times, the hydroxychloroquine helps. It helps so much, my pain levels are minimal and I feel more human than I have in the 16 years it took to get diagnosed. There's hope, always.",General,1

Ultimately it was discovered to be Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia. Having ADH increases your chances of developing breast cancer. I also have very dense breast which makes it harder to identify cancer on the mammogram.  I have no family history but I'm considered high risk.  So every 6 months I have to  either get a MRI or a mammogram and I've been referred to a Breast Cancer Dr to discuss my options which ranges from being on more cancer drugs with 6 months screenings,  I'm already on Methotrexate.

Hi! So this is like my third time posting in the last few months, but life is not getting any better for me at the moment. I have had two flares within the past four months, but the down time in between was nothing amazing as I was tapering of Prednisone.

New symptoms have arisen that include:

* chest pain
* hair loss (resulting in a bald spot on my temple)
* shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing
* dry eyes and mouth
* serious stomach issues that impact daily life

This is all in addition to my symptoms that started in May of 2021. Those symptoms include:

* migraines
* vision changes
* increased fatigue
* increased anxiety
* light sensitivity
* joint pain
* appetite changes

Not to mention so many others that I can never remember because of the brain fog.

Last night the chest pain got so bad that I went to the ER after days of debating with my mom & bf. I was diagnosed with pleurisy, and was given multiple tests/scans due to a concern of blood clots in my lungs (still a possibility). They noted tachycardia in my chart, as well as myocarditis, both things that need to be taken seriously in lupus patients. I was given a CT, X-ray, and a three day dose of 40mg Prednisone.

I was waiting to get into my rheum until October, but I called this morning and they are finally getting me in on Tuesday (sept. 7th)! I am so excited, but still incredibly anxious as I am worried I won't be taken seriously as that has already been happening quite a bit with my doctors.

I have been working with the disability services at my university, but there is only so much they can do.

I ate and drank juice and peanut butter. I kept testing it and could never get it above 75. I felt like my arms and legs were stuck in sand when I walked. I had to lean against trees when taking my dogs outside. My fingers started swelling. 

Thursday I went to my PCP. My bgl was 51. My blood pressure was super high and I had an abnormal ekg. I couldn‚Äôt talk, my brain was extremely foggy, and I was just spacey. I lost all feeling in my hands and feet. They turned blue and stone cold. She sent me to the ER. They did four tests (counting a pregnancy test) then told me they didn‚Äôt see anything life threatening and sent me home. I was miserable all weekend.

590,6,"Hi guys, I'm a 24yr old female and I was diagnosed with SLE and APS at 12, have had severe vasculitis, blood clots, progressive autoimmune hearing loss+tinnitus, secondary SVT, and overall have had a pretty shitty time with managing my illness up until about a year ago when my bloodwork started showing improvements. I just got some more labs done this last week, and most of it was so normal that you wouldn't know I had a chronic illness just looking at the results. The only things out of whack were a slightly low C4 and some vitamin markers, but my ANA and dsDNA titers were way out of normal range, so I definitely still have lupus. Additionally, I still feel like absolute dog shite most of the time. My joints always hurt, I can never get on a consistent exercise regimen bc it agitates one body part or another so badly I can't use it for 3 days minimum, my reynaud's is the worst it's ever been, I have constant headaches, dizziness, loss of sensation, ocular migraines, sleeping problems, fatigue and it seems like the list goes on. My doctor almost seemed disbelieving about my complaints when we went over the results. I guess my question in general is if anyone experiences something like this? Like, my labs say I should be feeling fine, and yet I'm very far from fine. It's all very discouraging and idk if I can go through the rest of my life with how I'm currently feeling being my new normal. Anyone have any advice?

I have lupus nephritis and I am not treating it with cytoxan as my body couldn‚Äôt tolerate the mycophenolate nor did my labs improve (got worse over a month).

Many of us on the team have an autoimmune disease and are working toward building a long-term, autoimmune care experience centered around community, holistic care, and continued support from health coaches experienced in autoimmune care.

We're currently surveying people with autoimmune conditions to understand how this new care experience might sound to people in their individual autoimmune journeys. The survey will take approximately 15 minutes. During the survey, you'll be able to: click through a prototype of our website where we explain the care experience and all its components, answer questions about your general impressions, points of confusion, what might be missing, etc.

Every day, I've been so inspired by the resilience and true determination behind the scenes in making this autoimmune care experience a reality (for people who have already gone through so much to find this type of care themselves). If you can spare even these 15 minutes, it would mean so much to us for you to include your voice and help us shape the future of autoimmune care! Thank you so much!

600,5,"I'm curious if anyone else has had knee pain that is due to inflamed and thickened synovial plica.  There's no swelling or stiffness. The imaging clearly shows that the plica is inflamed and thickened. When it's really inflamed, it gets pinched when I bend my knee and causes a knife sharp pain. The pain had never gone away entirely since this began over a year ago, but it varies considerably. When it's bad, it hurts to walk and I need to go down stairs backwards, one step at a time. When it's relatively okay, it's tolerable and I can do a lot of stuff. Jogging and lunging is always out of the question, though.

It seems to be from systemic inflammation (other causes ruled out, it's not an overuse injury and no amount of rest or PT has made a difference, and it started suddenly in both knees simultaneously) so I accept it's a symptom of my Lupus.

But trying to make a very long story short I feel like she's done fuck all apart from prescribing HCQ in the time I've been seeing her.  Her usual response to everything is ""Yeaaaah that's just what this is like.  Come back in three months.""

She's given me no suggestions for dealing with the pain.  She didn't warn me that allergic reactions would trigger lupus flareups in spite of a ridiculously long allergy list in my chart.  She told me I couldn't do anything about the rash on my feet which itches like I stepped in an ant's nest - my primary care doctor was seeing me for something unrelated and said ""Wow that's bad! Let me prescribe you something for it.""  It cleared up in a few days and I'd had it for two months.  She told me the fact that I've literally become a shut-in because the HCQ makes me crap myself unexpectedly ""just means that it's working.  You should increase your dose."" (Spoiler alert: I didn't)  My GYN was seeing me for my annual visit and my joints were ridiculously swollen and she said ""Why aren't you taking your rescue meds for your lupus?  Don't you have prednisone?""  Fucking what???  No...my rheumatologist never mentioned this, why is my gynecologist telling me about it??  I complained about the pain yet again and the rheumatologist told me I should just be thankful I only have joint issues and no organ involvement.  Which...yes I'm VERY thankful I know lots of folks have it a lot worse but that's not helping.  And finally she ran more blood tests which were much worse than the last ones and when I asked her what it meant she got kind of snappish and said ""It doesn't mean anything!""

I was seeing my primary for a follow-up last week and I wound up ranting about it to him because I feel like this is completely taking over my life.  And his response was ""Well the thing with autoimmune stuff as I understand it is sometimes there's not a lot you can do.""  Ok I get that.  I don't expect her to have all the answers.  I don't expect her to make me 100% again because I know that won't happen.   
 But I feel like trying one drug that makes me shit myself uncontrollably and providing no other information or suggestions is bullshit.

I found y'all today and I hope that some of you can help me. I was diagnosed with severe Fibromyalgia, and recently Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease plus Sjogrens Syndrome.

Apparently that's the only medication they can give me for my Sjogrens and I'm extremely upset. Between the Sjogrens and Fibromyalgia, I can't function in society; I was supposed to start medical training but I can hardly walk, I have no energy, constant pain, sick every other week, etc.


That notwithstanding, I basically suffer from lupus (my great aunt had it and died in her thirties from it) but my blood work says there aren't any markers.

I want to thank everyone who has contributed because I have found this sub comforting and helpful throughout my medical process. I am unsure what to do and wanted to seek advice and possible guidance? 

\*\*\*Mods, I am not sure if this is the right thread or not.

I have been dismissed constantly by many doctors and specialists. I don't normally post, so I wanted honest feedback/advice. I'm going to try my best to quickly list what has happened to give you an idea of what they have found so far:

  
\- I had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, HIDA scan, MRI, and two ultrasounds done within the past few months. I have also had a lot, and I mean A LOT of bloodwork done, so my arms are still bruised and swollen because of how often I am being pricked.   
\- Results for colonoscopy came back basically normal. Endoscopy showed that erosion in the duodenum had esophageal stenosis (benign), and flattened mucosa was found. I do not have celiac, and from my colonoscopy, I don't have Crohn's or anything else related. However, I have continued to have extreme bloating and pain.   
\- HIDA scan showed that I have a hyperkinetic gallbladder, so my gallbladder doesn't work. They are not considering surgery now because I am still dealing with basic G.I. issues that I am currently trying to treat. However, they are requesting another endoscopy to make sure the medication is working.  
\- Blood work for b12 came back abnormal, and I was deficient. My ferritin levels and monocytes were also low. I also have a high WBC, and there isn't a clear cause. They tested my CRP (14.6) and ESR (21), and both were elevated. Additionally, I have high cholesterol now (not needing medication), am insulin resistant (discovered I have PCOS), and slightly elevated testosterone levels.   
\- I did have cysts on my ovaries (the PCOS diagnosis) and a benign tumor in the uterus wall.   
\- Rash on my scalp and I have a lesion on my arm, as well as confirmed hair loss (unknown cause)  
\- Eye rash that my PCP claims could also be autoimmune-related  
\- Sinus tachycardia also awaiting further workup for heart palpitations

  
However, this doesn't explain many other symptoms I am still experiencing, and many doctors suggested I see a Rheumatologist. These symptoms are:

  
\- Face rash that comes and goes, usually on my cheeks and across the bridge of my nose. I also get random rashes on me that appear out of nowhere. I suspect I am intolerant to heat or the sun, but I am not sure, so I have been trying to pay closer attention.  
\- My vision seems to be impacted. Sometimes my eyes move rapidly (involuntarily) while I am just minding my own business. Sometimes have pain behind the eyes.  
\- I had headaches every day for two weeks straight and, in general, have had a lot of headaches.  
\- Sometimes my hands shake too much that I can't grip things and drop them often.   
\- I also get rashes that burn on my hands and feet that look almost blotchy.  
\- Hands, wrists, fingers, and ankles swell and sometimes are stiff. They also hurt, and I can't usually even hold my phone. Unfortunately, this has been happening more often.    
\- I urinate a lot at night, sometimes have burning, but not often. Sometimes it looks super dark or foamy despite how much water I drink ( I mainly only drink water).   
\- Body aches and pains all over. One in particular that gets bad is my left side to the point that I can't even walk, sit, or even lie down. It becomes so painful and stiff.   
\- Feeling dizzy when walking or standing, feeling like I am being ""pushed down"" from the top of the head. Idk how to describe it, but it doesn't feel normal.   
\- My lymph nodes get so swollen/they hurt that I can't lift my arms sometimes, specifically in the armpit and groin areas.   
\- Stuttering that has never occurred ever in my life and constant brain fog. I can't think or formulate anything.   
\- constant fatigue and lower back pain or neck pain  
\- mouth sores that appear on my tongue or in my mouth  
\- Night sweats

  
I am sure I am forgetting other things, but I don't want to be dismissed at my appointment and do want to be taken seriously. I am scheduled with a PA-C in November, virtually. What do you suggest?

622,0,"Just wanted to ask for general advice from those either suffering from lupus/autoimmune issues or perhaps have a much better knowledge of it than I. Apologies in advance for this will certainly be lengthy as I want to try and get as much information that may be relevant included. 

I‚Äôve generally had some of these symptoms for several years, mostly manifesting in my later teen years. However, I have noticed a drastic increase and addition of symptoms as a result of appendicitis and peritonitis that occurred in late 2019 whilst I was abroad. Following a return to the UK I went through a four month period of severe night sweats, chronic pain in joints, muscles and chest, sudden weight loss, fatigue and what I perceived to be flushing on the central portion of my face/nose. Thankfully, I was able to improve health wise but do not feel since the incident I have fully recovered. One of my main concerns has been lupus or autoimmune-related issues, which were only brought to my attention due to the ‚Äòflushing‚Äô on my face. My other symptoms which have caused concern include;

\- Mouth ulcers. I have always been someone afflicted with ulcers, particularly when unwell. However, they‚Äôre far more common now and often find themselves in areas where no teeth-related trauma could have caused them (under the tongue, back of the throat, the outside of my lips,  roof of mouth etc.)

\- Joint and bone pain, strangely more so on the left side of my body in fingers, knee, hip etc.

\- Kidney infection ‚Äì twice in the left kidney last year which was thankfully mild and did improve after a long course of antibiotics and painkillers. 

\- Stomach issues, which are by no means new to me. However, this year I‚Äôve now become accustomed to having acid reflux and globus sensation, something that I hadn‚Äôt experienced prior to January 2021.

\- Migraines, which my doctor has also referred to as ‚Äòcluster headaches‚Äô due to the pattern they follow. Typically deal with by laying in a quiet darkened room, with tiger balm being the only thing that offers any sort of relief. I do have two benign brain tumours, which were ultimately diagnosed as a result of my GP doing an MRI to look into the headaches. I‚Äôve been assured that the headaches are not to do with the tumours, which my GP/endocrinologist are in agreement would be too small to cause any significant pain (I tend to agree with them). 

\- Sudden onset fever/feeling of malaise or flu-like symptoms. This is harder to explain, but randomly some days (typically late afternoon) I‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôve developed a cold or flu, and will follow the process of drinking lots of fluids, taking paracetamol or whatever OTC remedy I have‚Ä¶ and then bizarrely by the time I wake up the next day all symptoms have vanished. These weird flares off ‚Äòtemporary‚Äô illness typically cause me to flush badly, severe migraine, high temperature, blocked nose/sore throat and swollen glands. I cannot notice an obvious pattern of what causes these, but it‚Äôs typical I get them after a day involving a lot of activity/travel (particularly prevalent when going to and from work). 

\- Central erythema which I initially believed was rosacea. Neither parent in my family has rosacea, but I had assumed rosacea based off it fitting the description for Subtype 1 (telangiectasia, symmetrical redness which initially came and went but has over time become more permanent due to strained blood vessels). The area itself feels warm, and I do my best to keep it out of sunlight/avoid stereotypical rosacea triggers. 

A follow up with my doctor several months ago led to them asking to see a picture of the rash, which worried him as he felt it fit (in his mind) the appearance of a ‚Äòbutterfly rash‚Äô. This combined with several family members having autoimmune issues (celiac disease, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis) enabled him to send me for several blood tests. The doctor had told me that one test (celiac) came back negative, which was of no surprise to me as I‚Äôve never noticed an issue with gluten. He also had put me down for an ANA, which I never received the results for but am of the belief it was negative. I am uncertain as I had to call the surgery weeks after to request the result, only to find out the doctor in question had move practices, but I was informed by the secretary that as far as she could see on my notes ‚Äúall normal‚Äù. Months later though I still find myself afflicted by the above symptoms, and it is really beginning to take a mental toll on top of the already strained physical pain such symptoms provide. I am due to start a new career at the end of September and really want to get a jump on any medical follow ups I should be looking into, and primarily I cannot shake the autoimmune/lupus angle despite the supposed negative ANA. I do know that many individuals with autoimmune issues (a family member included) go undiagnosed for years, and whilst I‚Äôd like to say I‚Äôm free of any such condition, I also want to ensure I am doing right by my own health if that includes not being satisfied by my current situation and what I feel at times is a lack of interest from my local general practitioner/s. 

My main questions would be

Would I be wrong to completely accept autoimmune issues (lupus in particular) are highly-unlikely if this first ANA as far as I‚Äôm aware has come back negative? Are my symptoms even remotely similar to what anyone here faces? Or perhaps hallmarks for other conditions/illnesses that I‚Äôm unaware of? I feel the more I know or am prepared with would certainly make the managing of this strange health-episode easier. Many thanks to all in advance!",Advice,0

624,12,"Hi everyone. I was just diagnosed with SLE (and secondary APS). I have never experienced any sun sensitivity thus far. In fact, I've always tolerated sunlight relatively well. I always wear sunscreen and a hat to protect my face (I'm prone to hyperpigmentation on my face only), but regularly walk in 90 degree heat in tanks and shorts. I LOVE the sun and the heat and tolerate it very well. I hydrate, but I never find it to be too much. I do try to always wear full body sunscreen and after this diagnosis, will be religious about this.

**So, here's my question**: Is it possible that the sun is causing flares and damage even if I don't experience sun sensitivity or rashes after being in the sun? That is, might I be harming myself by spending time in the sun without realizing it? I know that I may suddenly become sun sensitive when I wasn't before ... I think I'm in the early stages of SLE. (Just started hydroxychloroquine and hoping this will help to prevent things from getting worse.)

**Here's another way to put the question**: I know that not everyone with SLE is photosensitive. But are the UV rays especially bad for all people with SLE, including those who do not have any obvious adverse reaction?

I'll be super religious about sun protection all over my body regardless, but basically I want to know if it's foolish to walk in the heat in tanks and shorts even with good sunscreen covering my body. I live in Alabama, so it's pretty hot here.

I should say, the reason I'm reluctant to cut back on my ""outside time"" is because, like many others, I find that being outside in the light--especially walking or exercising in the light--really helps with depression an anxiety. I work near windows whenever possible to try to keep my mood up. I'm having a bit of trouble dealing with the SLE and APS diagnoses and don't want to make things harder on myself by avoiding sunlight unnecessarily. I'm hoping that good sunscreen and maybe some new protective clothing will be sufficient.

Nothing too serious, but couldn't breathe properly for the next three months, then hospitalized for 10 days with normal blood tests but severe joint pain, hot waves and sweatness from nowhere, extreme fatigue and of course my heart problems plus the fact that my heart was REALLY aching, like I thought I was going to pass out‚Äîto be clear, I started with those symptoms before those horrible three months. Left the hospital without a diagnose, but a month later at my doctor's appointment she says ""it may be lupus but I need a more time. Give me some months"".

with all of this I was like ""ok, this is nothing too serious"" but God it is. I can't go back to the life I had before.

I have one for sure that has no cure but nobody knows if it is lupus or what!

still figuring out that last point, knowing that I got to live with a disease is not something you learn at school or that your parents teach you or prepare you to fight...

626,7,"I am recently diagnosed with lupus, and have a questioned about ANA Results.

I have chronic kidney disease and back in January my new nephrologist wanted to see if she could figure out the underlying cause of my disease. She ran a bunch of labs and everything came back normal and I didn't think much of it. Fast forward to this month and I was diagnosed with lupus and my rheumatologist said that lupus could be the cause of my CKD. 

I didn't think to ask him at the time, but on a whim went and looked at the labs my nephrologist did in January and she had checked ANA and it was negative. The first panel done my by rheumatologist showed 1:160 (speckled) in June and the second panel (Avise CTD) showed a titer of 1:320 (homogenous) in July. Obviously I can ask him when I see him again next month at my follow up, but I am really curious if it's ""normal"" to have a negative ANA and then 6 months later be positive? 

He said he would request the records from my nephrologist so he would have them for my next visit, so I am sure he will see this as well.

I have been having symptoms off and on for about 9 years so it just seems odd that I would have had a negative ANA in January if I have lupus. 

I guess I am just questioning if I have the right diagnosis, and if this has ever happened to anyone else. 

My Avise CTD showed positive (tier 2) for lupus, and that coupled with other labs and symptoms led my rheumatologist to diagnose me with lupus. I did have a large number of visits (with him, my GP, and a few other specialists along the way) leading to my diagnosis. At my first visit the rheumatologist said that I might have fibromyalgia, as I don't have any rashes so he wasn't initially thinking it was actually lupus.

In conclusion, clinical and ultrasound-proved enthesitis are frequent in SLE patients. Quadriceps tendon insertion is the most affected enthesis. Clinical enthesitis tends to occur in older SLE patients. GUESS score notably correlated with; age,¬†BMI, and SLEDAI-2K score. BMI and SLEDAI-2K are predictors for increased GUESS score.

641,6,"Hi all,

In the beginning of this summer I had multiple skin biopsies and they showed lupus. The dermatologist referred me to a rheumatologist, because of the fevers I‚Äôm experiencing since 2006, malar rash that I have since 2015 (the malar rash is confirmed with a biopsy as well), dryness, hair loss, mouth and nose ulcers and many many more symptoms. She thought I have systemic lupus probably and not only skin lupus. 

But the rheumatologist (it was not the first I had seen since 2008) was very rude and dismissive. My blood work showed: low albumin, slightly anemic but normal b12, folic acid and iron and ferritin. Low leukocytes, low positive ANA, sjogren antibodies were not tested with the new test they had. I had high sed rate and normal CRP. The teardrop eye test (schirmer test) was positive. I had 1mm in both eyes, normal range is 10+mm. 

The IGM test was almost too low. Under 0.40 is too low and I had 0.40. 

My urine had leukocytes in it and red blood cells. No bacteria found. 

My blood pressure was high, 150/90. Though normally it was always low and they didn‚Äôt check again to confirm the high blood pressure.  

I have swollen ankles and fingers. And raynaud‚Äôs, also in summer when temperatures change suddenly from hot to ‚Äòcold‚Äô. 

But all these things were fine, said the rheumatologist. He diagnosed me with fibromyalgia. Here in my country in Europe they don‚Äôt treat fibromyalgia.. 

About the mouth ulcers he said: ‚Äúyou only get those on the roof of your mouth, so it‚Äôs not auto immune. Then you would get them on your lips. And it‚Äôs abnormal you only get them on the same place every time.‚Äù

About the malar rash he said: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs sunburn and looks like a malar rash because your wear sunglasses‚Äù

The dryness didn‚Äôt get addressed either. It‚Äôs from my birth control pill he said. He didn‚Äôt listen to me telling him I‚Äôm only on birth control since two years and the dryness started way before that. 

He also said I look way too healthy to be sick. ‚ÄúYou have a perfect figure and weight, you have a nice tan, it‚Äôs not sle, enjoy your healthy body‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt know what to do now. My GP doesn‚Äôt want to refer me to another rheumatologist, she says I‚Äôm fine and she‚Äôs okay with it if I want to talk about it with a psychiatrist. And that I just need to continue applying the creams I got for my skin and avoid the sun. 
She said I‚Äôm way to self conscious about my health and I already saw enough specialists since 2008. You never got a diagnosis besides fibromyalgia, so there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you.

654,4,"My situation is a little unique. I've been diagnosed with UCTD, but I have an identical twin who's been diagnosed with lupus. I'd say we have about 80% symptom overlap, although historically her symptoms have had a bigger impact on her daily functioning than mine have. The symptoms I have that she doesn't (e.g. raynauds) aren't specific to lupus, while the symptoms she has that I don't (e.g. sun rashes) are. 

Because her symptoms were clinically mild in terms of organ damage and certain lupus-specific blood markers, she struggled for several years to find a doctor who would be willing to treat her with something more robust than plaquenil. She almost dropped out of college because of negligence from her rheumatologists. When she was finally put on prednisone, there was a huge improvement and she went from barely scraping by to excelling in college.

Her current rheumatologist has had her on Benlysta for about a year now, in the hopes that she can stop taking prednisone for good (currently takes a 10mg maintenance dose). His opinion is that this drug should be available to clinically mild patients, specifically to prevent their lupus from worsening. Over the past year, she's seen even greater improvements with Benlysta, with seemingly few side effects. 

I've been struggling more and more with my own health recently. Plaquenil has done very little for me, and LDN sadly didn't seem to do much either. The symptoms that affect me the most are more general autoimmune symptoms (fatigue, malaise, muscle soreness, dysautonomia, etc. - all things she experiences as well). I won't lie that seeing the success she's had on Benlysta has been very tempting, and I'm considering asking my rheumatologist if he would be willing to explore prescribing this for me as well (we see the same person). I don't want to ask about this though if it's not feasible or practical. If Benlysta is never given to UCTD patients, I don't want to put myself out there and look like a fool.",General,0

656,2,"UPDATE:

So, yesterday was the big day.  As I'd said, I'd set this all up in my head as being The Day of Answers and Getting Sorted.  Well, as I'm sure most of you know, that was not going to happen.

First off, my Rheum is lovely.  We had a good chat and a good laugh too.  And he sent me off to have a full armful of blood tests taken, marked them urgent so I could get them done yesterday too.  (Unfortunately they couldn't be done yesterday as today and Monday are Bank Holidays, and some of the bloods have to go to the UK which wouldn't happen until Tues, so the phleeb told me to come back Tues so they'll get sent straight across, but nice of Rhuem to try).  

He agreed that ""something auto immune"" is going on, but wants to investigate EVERYTHING; explaining that as I work in a hospital he doesn't want to suppress my immune system without knowing that that's the right thing to do.  So he'll see me again in 8-10 weeks with all the results and we'll make a plan from there.  He's also referred me back to my GP for thyroxine as given my family history of Hashimotos and my low T4, he said that it wouldn't hurt to start.  I also have a chest CT next week too, so the week goes: BH Monday, Bloods on Tuesday, GP Wednesday and CT Thursday!  I joked that I'll be at the hospital so much I may as well work there!  

So all in all, disappointed to not be magically cured (or at least on treatment), but reassured by his plan of care, explanations and the fact that someone is finally listening to me.  


Hi all

Not sure what I'm looking for from this post, mostly just writing it out for myself I think.

I'm finally seeing Rheumatology tomorrow after my initial GP suggested it in December.  I've been back and forth to my GP for years with joint pain, mostly hands, lingering low grade fevers and feeling exhausted.  Initially I thought it was getting older +/- menopause, but I'm only 41 so ü§∑.   Eventually my GP, having looked back at my test results from the previous year, saw a positive ANA 1:160, speckled, homogeneous, and a CRP of 12, and out of the blue (to me) mentioned Lupus. She wanted to refer me to Rheumatology but there wasn't a Rheumatologist in our local trust.  Since then I've been seen other GPs (house move), had bloods repeated (last ANA higher but they didn't tell me the numbers, and I'd get in trouble looking it up myself), and they've all agreed that yep, Rheumatologist input needed, most likely Lupus.

The rash on my face has been coming and going for 3 years; again I thought it was something menopausal like acne and have spent a fortune on skin care products to fix it.  Mouth ulcers, nose ulcers exacerbated by oh so many bloody Covid swabs.  Basically I finally had an answer to what's wrong with me (I mean, who needs a walking stick at 40?  That's not normal!), and I've taken on board all the Lupus advice; rest, no immune system boosters, careful in the sun, etc etc.  

I''ve been off work for nearly 3 weeks now with what I'm assuming is a flare; I can't get my temp below 37.8, I'm exhausted doing the smallest of things; occy health advised to stay off until I've seen Rheum at least.  Last week I ended up in A&E with ""probably pleurisy.""  Got some prednisolone, had some nebs and then had to get a taxi back to the GP's surgery where I'd left my car (GP sent me in via ambo, humiliating as I work in that hospital).  

BUT, what if the doc laughs at me?  What if my problem isn't Lupus but just that I'm weak and lazy?  I've always been active and busy, this fatigue is so frustrating, but what if it's all in my head?  I have long term depression, have been stable on meds for a few years and this time I'm not coming off them, but I still have that little b@$t@¬£d that is my depression (his name is Cecil, I named him many years ago) whispering in my mind's ear that it's just me being lazy and useless.  I've built this appointment up so much, that now I'm really stressing out.  Was up from 3am to 5.30am this morning with my mind talking at me.  What if the doc says he can't do anything for me, that this is the rest of my life?  I'm so scared.",General,0

About 5 weeks ago I started having a tightness in my chest off and on which I contributed to the wildfire smoke from Canada, but one day about 3 weeks ago it suddenly got a lot worse while I was at work. I ended up going to urgent care and was diagnosed there with pericarditis. Before this I've had no prior heart problems. I was put on a colchicine and ibuprofen regimen for that, with a cardiologist follow up scheduled in about a month.

Two days ago I ended up in the ER due to terrible chest pains and tightness that were mostly in the left center. It felt like one of those chest bursters from the Alien movies was trying to break out while a grizzly bear was trying to hug me to death at the same time. The diagnosis there was ""something musculoskeletal"". After talking to my mom she said it was most likely Costochondritis and that she gets it a lot.

I've also been severally fatigued lately ever since the first pericarditis attack. I work outside a lot and can barely manage to walk a few thousand feet without having to take a few breaks because I'm so out of breath. My job isn't terribly active, I mostly sit for long periods with some walking here and there.

This all came on pretty quick out of nowhere, starting with the heavy chest feeling about 5 weeks ago. Does this sound like it could potentially be lupus? What should I talk to or ask my doctor about?

I should also maybe mention that I've had one other time in the past, maybe 10 years ago, of a random chest pain that was also chalked up to be ""something musculoskeletal"" at that time too, as well as 3 past events of severe abdominal pain that there was no known cause of.

I was put on mast cell meds immediately to stop my reactions that were occurring back to back. 

They brought up lupus in Feb 2021, my ANA was negative. They pointed towards mast cell activation syndrome, but that's not confirmed or denied yet.

Then I finally got to the MD hours later, my pain was mild again, just sore. I spoke with internal medicine, they said maybe my markers weren't showing yet. So they're saying likely lupus again, or MS. The internist said I'm likely going to show markers eventually. 

Lupus is the more likely, my grandmother also had it, and MS/diabetes/celiac disease all running in my family which are autoimmune.

I was referred to a rheumatologist this year because of Raynaud's, swollen fingers, fatigue, ongoing GI issues and chronic back pain. I have many posts from the last year that explain in detail some of my symptoms, [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/ldxbjb/27fuk_ongoing_gi_issues_pelvic_pain_chronic_back/) probably being the most relevant to this thread.

It was my physio, in fact, who suggested I try and get some rheumatology blood test as I've had upper back pain for 5 years that is not responding to treatment of any kind. So, after months of NHS waiting times and trying to get referred by my GP, I finally got to see the rheumatologist in July of this year and they carried out some blood tests.

Apparently, all blood tests were normal except slightly raised double-stranded DNA. The normal range is up to 17, and I scored 23. Here is the letter I received this week:

https://preview.redd.it/ue97rwp1j5i71.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5577a4eb3c438f2c2a275f9469e0867d240722c9

This is all completely new to me and this is the only information I have been given. Having no idea what any of this meant, I researched and found that, to my understanding, you only have raised ds-DNA levels if you have Lupus. Is this correct or am I misinterpreting the results? I see there are two types of ds-DNA levels that have been tested, one being positive and the second negative. I don't understand what this means.

Based on these results, the rheumatologist has now diagnosed me with primarily Raynaud's and won't see me again unless my symptoms get worse.

Anyway she went to a dermatologist and they gave her an ANA test.  Her results were 1.80 for the titre and homogeneous for the pattern.

In all the research I‚Äôve done, 1.80 is low and not that conclusive.  We are now playing the waiting game to see what the next steps are.

My biggest concern for her is that my grandmother, her mother, died of scleroderma. I don‚Äôt want to make light of lupus at all as it is obviously terrible and painful, but after seeing what my grandma went through, we are praying it‚Äôs lupus and not scleroderma.

744,36,"Hello, my name is robo, I'm a 41 year old dude who, after years of mystery illness, was finally tested and diagnosed with systemic lupus. I'm sorry lucky to be a stay at home dad, two kids, though I definitely am looking for work as something I can actually do. All my previous jobs have either been face to face customer service or very physical construction type jobs, so I definitely need to figure out something new.

I think the hardest thing for me was getting into really good shape and overcoming some other health issues, as I also have COPD due to an industrial accident about 13 years ago. Finally getting to a very healthy point, breathing properly, just very odd rashes and strange joint pains. Was in the gym one day, squatting, and after putting the weights up, I passed out and fell. Nothing was ever right again after that. Went from being very active, lifting weights and running several miles a day, to some days barely being able to get out of bed.

I was working towards a goal of entering a powerlifting meet, was squatting 2.5 times my bodyweight, and very much enjoy hiking and running. Then my knee blew out, meniscus ripped and the bones in my knee are degenerating and diseased. I ripped the joint by lifting a few cans of soda from the floor for my kids to put in the fridge. After that, both of my elbows also started to go, showing abnormalities in x-ray as well as the joints in my wrists starting to degenerate, and my knuckles as well.

I was hit with pretty severe depression, going from this very active person to having to walk with a cane and braces to hold my joints together. Luckily I have compression power lifting gear which actually helps. Because I'm a man, the RA told me it's very rare for me to actually have lupus, and it's only a little lupus anyway, I would be fine. I'm of Latin descent, and my uncle also had lupus, was diagnosed shortly before he passed. Even though I'm positive ANA with all of the symptoms she basically released me, took me off of hydroxychloroquine. Roughly a month after that is when the joint in my knee completely went, and the rest of my body fell apart. Luckily, my primary put me back on and also referred me to specialists in a city about an hour from me. The RA did note the swelling in my joints, especially my knee and elbows, but basically just completely dismissed me because, at the time, I was still in good physical condition, other than my butterfly on my face, giant patches in my elbows and knees as well as chest, and almost everything you would expect from a textbook case.

I'm blessed with a loving and accepting wife and kids who try to help me, though I'm very stubborn. It's hard for me to accept my new limitations, and I'm always pushing myself harder than I should and, of course, paying the price for it later. I do my best to keep moving and be active, even when it hurts. I do my best to stay healthy and positive, and rather than focus on all the things I can't do anymore I choose to look at what I can do, what I'm able to do, and how I can always try to improve. Some days are definitely worse than others, though.

I did find that, not only was brain fog an extreme issue, causing me to do things like wander my supermarket for about an hour, but also leading to some other weirdness, like hoarding certain things. I guess I'm holding on to things from when I was younger, before I had to deal with all the crap that we all deal with. I'm blessed that my kidney and liver function is okay, though my liver was a bit off and kidneys are starting to have some issues. I can deal with the hair falling out, though losing the hair from my beard, that hurts a little more, but it only hurts my pride! 

I'm sorry for this massive long post, I guess I just needed to get some of this off of my chest. I read a lot of posts and see that we are all dealing as best we can. I'm considering the third shot, as my immune system is toast but I relish still having that freedom. I see the community here as very welcoming and informative, and I hope to chat more, as I don't get out like I used to and that depression hits hard.

So this is a concept I made up called the ""Hot Potato Effect"" and I wanted to post this in here for three reasons: 

  
1. To see if other lupies have experienced this and how they handle it.  
2. I know there are doctors in nurses in here, and I feel this is helpful for you all to recognize and maybe provide some insight on your end, and/or gain an understanding of your patients.  
3. For family/friends/spouses of those with lupus, to give insight into the frustration of dealing with autoimmune diseases and that ""go to the doctor"" doesn't always help. 

I personally feel most comfortable contacting my Rheumatologist whenever there is an issue, as lupus is confusing and complicated case by case. I love my rheum, but I feel she is starting to get frustrated with me always coming to her instead of a PCP or other doctors. 

What she doesn't realize is that the very moment I mention that I have lupus to any doctor that is not a rheum, you'd think I said ""leprosy,"" as they tend to immediately shut down, freak out, and say, ""talk to your rheum."" 

I get it--- it's confusing and you don't want to tell me the wrong thing. But my rheum says to go to you, you say to go to my rheum, and then *no one* helps me. I feel passed around like a hot potato no one wants to touch. Thus, the **""Hot Potato Effect""** was born. 

Have any of you experienced this? Does anyone have helpful solutions or ways in which I can better communicate with my doctors how I feel?  Medical professionals, please feel free to chime in on your perspective, as well.

769,13,"I was diagnosed with lupus days before my 21st birthday. 6 months after having a heart attack, I have a blood condition caused by lupus. It's been a long 11 years of pain and sadness.  My lupus is pretty aggressive. I've been hospitalized 4 times in the last 3 years, all life threatening. Almost losing kidney function twice, a blood clot covering over 60% of my leg and an infection that almost spread to my colon. After my second hospitalized I gained 70 lbs of water weight basically over night which left me crippled. I was prescribed a high dose of prednisone, I was 6'4 340lbs before getting sick, and the water weight turned into real weight. The next year, same thing happened and I ballooned to 460lbs. This time the prednisone wasn't working so I had to do chemotherapy. During this time I became super depressed and missed a couple blood work appointments.

773,3,"So, I have ME/CFS, fibromyalgia and other chronic stuff since birth. Since my entire life has been dealing with doctors, hospitals and quacks, I used to think the absolute rubbish treatment I was getting in the medical community was normal or just me. It blew my mind when I realised I'm not alone, that this happens to basically anyone with chronic illness to a degree and this made me really angry.

I am also a researcher working at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research looking into the genetic drivers of autoimmune disorders which puts me in a unique position of being both patient and researcher. And I get ranty about patient advocacy. Luckily, my boss is awesome and took my rants to heart. After heating some of the stories that have happened to me and fellow spoonies, she got angry too. So we set up this project on chronic illness diagnostic journeys in Australia, including self diagnosis and self medication.

For this project, 'autoimmune disease' is being used as a umbrella term because of changing definitions and the like. So we are including ME/CFS, MS, Parkinsons, anything with chronic presentation. If it's not on the list, please put it in the 'other' section. The survey should take roughly 20 to 30 minutes, is easier to do on a laptop than a phone (sorry, ethics had opinions about which platform we are allowed to use) and if you need to stop, you‚Äôre sent a code to resume where you left off.

The further we can get this distributed, the more solid the statistical trends we can infer - and numbers are a lot harder for medical professionals to ignore than anecdotes. We  need you, as **healthy controls** as well as **spoonies.** If we can spread this far and wide, we hope we can get a good enough response rate to build an online platform that patients and doctors can use to expedite the time it takes to diagnosis.  

We have ethics approval, data is de-classified and everything will be open access. Info on the project and who we are, ethics and links are on the website below. If you have a look and think this project has merit, please participate, send to family, friends, different community groups and if you have any suggestions on how we can get the word out or any other feedback, please let me know.

Last January (17 at the time) I was hospitalized from drug induced ITP. What caused the ITP was Bactrim, was taking it for a normal UTI. My platelet count went all the way down to 0. I was tested for various different things since they didn't know what was wrong with me at first, and my ANA was positive & speckled. However, everything else was normal. I was treated with two IVIG treatments and discharged two weeks later. After this my health problems were exacerbated, I started having extreme edema and pitting in my legs to the point that it was painful to walk and it was made worse by physical activity and as I work at starbucks and am a full time student at a big university, there was a lot of walking. I also noticed I started to get these flare ups. I would get them pre-hospitalization, but they were mostly psychogenic fevers caused by stress with no other symptoms besides exhaustion. However after hospitalization they were accompanied with a burning butterfly rash, fatigue, frequently a headache and all over pain, I call it ""exhaustion pain"" I don't really have a better word for it. It happens randomly but seems to happen more when im stressed, happens at LEAST once a month but with finals season it's happening every week and lasts anywhere between a few hours-multiple days. I haven't mentioned this to my rheumatologist yet because I actually thought it was normal since my mother has the same types of flare ups but she is diagnosed with a handful of autoimmune disorders, i don't believe she is diagnosed with lupus though but it does run in my family. Lupus seems like the ""best bet"" diagnosis wise as my doctors are all sure i do have an autoimmune disease but it's a more of a waiting game to find out which it is as my blood hasn't hit most of the ""markers"". 
Lab results from January 2020:
- ANA positive & speckled 
- dsDNA negative
- antismith negative
- thyroid panel normal range
- c3 & c4 normal range

however I did get my c3 checked again in june and it was high but my doctor didn't mention anything, just ignored it and i can't remember if i had any flare up symptoms at that time.

other weird symptoms:
- scalp lesions & scabs
- hard time regulating temperature 
- extreme hand swelling to the point where it hurts and it's hard to move my hands, not caused by allergies just random.

15,23,"medicinal mushrooms for lupus Hi all,

Like many of us with lupus, I've been struggling to find the right medication regimen for me that balances symptom reduction against side effects. For me at least, I've been frustrated with immunosuppressants because they seem just make me weaker and less able to do things I love. It's unclear if it is just my lupus getting worse or if it's the drugs, but my goal is to get off of them to better answer that question. But what is stopping me at the moment is pain. Immunosuppressants do not get rid of it, but they seem to reduce it.  

Anyway, in my quest to manage pain and feel better, I've done a bunch of research on medicinal mushrooms. Im currently trying turkey tail at 2-3g per day (trying 3 now) for inflammation and pain and lions mane for brain fog. It's too early to tell if lions mane is working as it hasn't been 2-3 weeks. 

I've noticed some promising results with turkey tail and plan to add in reishi and cordyceps. All 3 have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects like dmards. Turkey tail is the most studied, it seems, for it's anti-cancer and tumor shrinking abilities. 

For me, my body seems more resilient to stress and more energy which is exciting. I still have lupus if course but I'm able to do more so I feel closer to how I felt when I was just on plaquenil and my lupus was more mild. I have noticed some pain relieving effects as well, but I do still have pain. 

Of course, with any alternative treatment, Western research and guidance is scarce. So I wanted to see what this community has experienced. Have they worked for you? For what symptoms? What doses? Thanks!",Advice,1

He gave me a scrip for Tamoxifen/Nolvadex (estrogen inhibitor) and I took it for about three months and for whatever reason just phased out from taking it, either I started to forget it or whatever. After about a month or two, my neck started getting a little red, then slowly and exponentially followed by my face getting more and more red.

This week people came into the office that were sick and said many other people from their Thanksgiving gatherings are sick too. When they were told by coworkers they need to go home they refused. While he works remotely the majority of the time he does have to be in close proximity with people who do work from the office in the next few weeks, people don't wear masks and the people that are sick are refusing to test. He's vaccinated, masks all the time, good with hand hygiene and I also got his booster scheduled before his trip but I just have this pit in my gut.

I started going when I was 20, and I am now 23. My mom has lupus and had a lot of difficulties in her 20s so I wanted to start going to the doctor early so they could track my symptoms and blood work as soon as symptoms started to worsen. 

Four months ago, I started having the worst flare-up I‚Äôve ever encountered. Almost every day since then, I have constant body aches, extreme fatigue, swollen joints, and overly sensitive skin. I‚Äôm posting because almost none of my blood work has been coming back abnormal enough for my rheumatologist to be concerned. I have a positive ANA and my symptoms are consistent with mixed connective tissue disease, SLE, and RA, but my blood work isn‚Äôt pointing to any of these diagnoses consistently, and because of my age my doctor is also hesitant to officially diagnose me with one or multiple of these in case it changes.

At my last rheumatologist appointment, because my pain and fatigue has been so bad for this long, my doctor recommended an immunosuppressant, an antidepressant that has been widely prescribed to help with autoimmune pain, and a huge diet overhaul. She told me to consider trying either of the med options, and to adjust my diet ASAP.

I almost didn't make it and if I had not been in the hospital already I'm sure I wouldn't be alive today. I had to have surgery to repair my heart and then finally was officially diagnosed with SLE.

This all happened in a hospital 3 hours from where I live because the local hospital said after the third pneumonia that they suspect lupus and sent me to the biggest hospital in the country because they have the proper specialists.

Right now I get a low fever every day, feel like absolute shit and am tired all the time. I'm not in pain particularly, but still worried about my heart and lungs.

I am 25 years old, female. I am autistic and have severe anxiety and a history of depression.  I've been in chronic joint pain for as long as I can remember. I started complaining about hip pain  when I was 4 years old.  Later diagnosed with scoliosis at 15, this has been the extent of explanation for that, and all of my other pain.I had a bunch of bloodwork done in early 2018, that I never got to see the results for. I have been struggling with a lot of fatigue, tachycardia, joint pain (and more but I'll describe symptoms shortly), which amped up in severity in 2016.I was told all tests normal, dr. started treating me with Cymbalta for Fibromyalgia. However, when I went back due to the medication not working and severely upsetting my stomach, I asked for a copy of my diagnosis due to my being on disability and wanting it for the government. The Dr. then told me it was not formally diagnosed as he's not a specialist - even though I was being treated for it. Treatment ceased, and I gave up.

I recently began trying again to figure what is going on. I had given up, felt crazy and that I must just be making it up in my head and tried to ignore it.A breakdown of what's been going on:I've been photosensitive my entire life. I did not know what was appearing looks like a malar rash until recently. It mostly appears when I'm exposed to sun, or very hot or very cold temperatures.Also if I'm feeling unwell. Which is frequently. I realize this may be Rosacea. I have photos of it from various ages and times in my life.I'm extremely tired all of the time. I never feel well rested no matter how much or how little sleep I get. I feel very worn down all of the time.I get random hives and rashes, mostly on my feet or my thighs other than what appears on my face. Sometimes itchy but often appear out of no where and painless and look like either red dots or purpura.Joint pain in the hips, knees, shoulders, elbows, ankles, wrists and sometimes knuckles.The pain can range from a intense burning sensation, sharp stabbing sensation to a dull ache.Sometimes I get what feels like the growing pain that I got as a kid, in my lower legs (the bone between the knee and the ankle) and it radiates, hurts a lot.Joints hot to the touch when they hurt sometimes.I had thick hair as a kid, stylists told me it was very thick. It started thinning out a lot 4 or 5 years ago and has never been the same since. I don't seem to lose it alarmingly anymore but I do lose more brushing it than I ever did before.I get headaches AT LEAST once a week.I'm clumsy all of the time, I struggle to open heavy public place doors, I feel like I'm just a messy person and constantly dropping items, juggling things around and having poor coordination and running into things.  
fingers and toes get very cold easily and hard to warm up - not to the extent of Reynaud's, as I have a friend who has it and know how white they get. My fingers get white in the middle and red/ blue ish at the tips\*Do not know about fevers. I don't have a way to take my temp so I am gonna go ahead and say no, sometimes I feel I might but I'm gonna eliminate that\*

Now where I'm asking for help knowing all of this information, I \*JUST\* had bloodwork done ordered by a regular GP  on Monday and am still waiting on my results but most are back now, at least the important ones (RA Factor, ANA, CRP, anti-CPP, ESP)  and these are all negative.  RA Factor was 13, the lab says their ""normal"" range is 0-15...so I do not think that is indicative of anything.ANA just says ""Negative"" there is no way to see my titer rating or anything. It does not say their reference ranges.

With that being said...I'm at a loss, I do not know what to do. I feel crazy, and I'm wondering if it's just normal for everyone to be in this much pain? I know surely it can't be Lupus if the ANA is negative but I don't know if there is more to that or not.  Or what else could really be going on other than  it being in my head. The ONLY other thing I can think to push for is looking in to Osteoarthritis, fibro or trying to push for a rheumatologist referral that I won't likely get, to do more thorough testing (anti-dsDNA, Anti-Sm, Anti-Rs/SSA, immonofluorescent IFA) .But with a negative ANA I don't know if this is worth doing.

Background information - my lupus is moderate to severe, and I am on a biologic as well as plaquenil. I take prednisone as needed (usually a few times a year). 

I was fully vaccinated this spring and received my booster in September. I primarily work from home, but am in the community regularly for grocery shopping. I see about ten people on a regular basis. Other than lupus, I am not in any other high risk category. 

Symptoms - I started feeling sick four days ago, very similar to the flu. The next day I really felt flu-ish (body aches, fatigue, headache, fever). Yesterday I took a rapid test as well as a PCR. Rapid showed a clear positive, and PCR should be back today or tomorrow but is expected to confirm. 

I‚Äôve been sick plenty with lupus, and yesterday/last night was my hardest experience with being sick, including my worst flares. Cyclical fevers (waking up soaked in sweat), intense headache (specifically, eye pain - yesterday I couldn‚Äôt even have my eyes open the pain was so excruciating), and general fatigue and malaise (but being in too much pain to sleep). Muscle aches/cramps, wet cough, and difficulty catching my breath.

I have no doubt that things would be very different if I weren‚Äôt vaccinated. I also informed all my doctors and they are arranging an antibody IV which has been shown to reduce severity of symptoms in moderate Covid (also, so insane to think what I have is moderate!).

I definitely would not wish this on anyone, but wanted to share my experience because, even though this is awful, I‚Äôm going to make it through.

‚Ä¢Generally a undereater whole life,somewhat skinny 

‚Ä¢For the past 7-8 months(perhaps even as long as 2 years) I have been getting frequent low-grade fevers.

‚Ä¢So far unable to find out the cause or any apparent pattern;sometimes it happens after physical activity,sometimes i can workout/work with intensity and be fine.

‚Ä¢As time passes,the frequency of the fevers appears to increase - severity appears to be the same.

‚Ä¢I was taking vitamins called IMMUNOGLUKAN(vitamin C,zink and something called imunoglukan)for multiple months,in addition to 1 month of using vitamin B supplements as well.
During the first month of this i had no fevers,functioned normally and thought that vitamin deficiencies vere the culprit;however the fevers came back after some time  and i was still using the vitamin C and zink supplements;i only used vitamin B supplemntation for one month.

‚Ä¢Temperature is usually normal in the morning,then about 16-18h starts to increase

‚Ä¢Symptoms of what i refer to as ""fever""(apologise if i used the wrong term):
- I feel weary,get teary eyed,trouble focusing

-Muscle aches(mostly in the calves,sometimes in upper leg,rarely anywhere else,but always in the calves)

-Body temperature NEVER goes above 37C(98.6F)
Sometimes it is very slightly elevated than normal,but i feel something is wrong.If my body temp is higher than 37C,it happens maybe a few times a year,with strong evidence that it is common cold/flu.When it comes to my 'regular' fevers it is NEVER higher than this.

-General fatigue,increased sensitivity to the cold

When i first realised that the frequent occurence of my fevers is abnormal and decided to visit the doctor(about august this year),i did a whole line of blood works:if i understand correctly,we have ruled out the following ailments:
-Any thyroid related condition
-Leukemia
-Most auto immune diseases
-Hormonal problems
-Cancer
I also never tested positive to Covid-19,in spite of the fact that my entire household has had it twice,been tested positive,and even though i had some general symptoms also found in the common colds,at the same time as them,i never once tested positive.
My bloodwork results,urine tests,throat swabs always come,without fail,completely normal with no sign of anything that indicates any underlying condition.
I don't know if this is related in any way,but for a long time i always have trouble getting up in the morning, regardless of how much i have slept.I usually get good wuality 8hrs sleep,but rarely ever wake up feeling 'energised'.
I am getting really frustrated to the point i HOPE that 1 test comes back with some answers.At this point i would feel relieved even if it was a serious ilness,as long as i KNEW what it was.This 'condition' is seriously impacting my life.I am lucky that  even if my work is demanding,i maybe work only 10-12 days a month,and make enough money that i can spend the rest of the month lying in my bed if i have to,but even if i dont go to work for an entire month,symptoms are the same so i believe that physical overexertion is not in the equation.

First time posting here, with a very specific question! For context: Im 20F, and have been on Cellcept (mmf) and Plaquenil for SLE since the age of 13, with my symptoms being mostly severe joint pain and mobility issues. This was my worst flare-up and I've been symptom free since being medicated, for the last 7 or so years.

So I'm wondering if anyone here with a similar medical history has been cold water swimming/ winter swimming. It's something I've been very keen on trying, but it occurred to me that this could potentially do more harm than good with the SLE component..  I used to experience Reynaud's quite consistently through the colder months, though not so much in the last year or two, and I obviously don't want to cause a flare from the shock to the body.... anyone have any thoughts? :)

My rheumatologist took x rays of my joints and found that I have early onset osteoporosis in my feet. I also know that x rays aren't the best at detecting anomalies in the joints. 

In March, I tested positive for the RNP antibody and I was prescribed hydroxychloroquine as well as gabapentin. I did another round of blood work a couple weeks ago and tested positive for RNP again. I told my doctor I was feeling very fatigued lately and that it makes it difficult for me to do daily functions. When my blood results came back, she basically said ""you have a history of testing positive for the RNP antibody, please make an appointment with your physician so she can look into your fatigue.""

This left me feeling very frustrated and at a loss, because I just don't know where to go from here. I felt like her response was dismissive and that she should have at least told me the next course of action. I don't really know what to say to her or what to ask.

What should I know Well I‚Äôm 19 and three and a half years ago I was in a car accident that nearly took my life, I used to attend a chronic pain clinic before covid and never really attributed my pain to anything else. 

I recently got a new family doctor as my old family doctor was horrible. To be brief she said my tremor was because I am ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù (I‚Äôm hardly overweight and I do not look overweight) which was later found out to be due to my brain damage. I did not get my period for three years and she blamed it on me being overweight (later found out it was due to trauma to my uterus during the accident)
She lowered my medication dosage after my psychiatrist upped them. She refused to explore treatment options for TMJ until I lost weight (again I am not overweight, I am average) 

I go to bed around 8:30 pm and get about 11 hours of sleep every night. I‚Äôm tired but I kinda just always thought I needed more sleep then others and never was concerned.

I haven't spent time with my partner in person in over a year because I am immunocompromised (i.e. I have a low immune system due to chronic illnesses) and I have too much anxiety and not enough energy to deal with covid so I stay home 100% of the time (except for medical appointments for which I have no choice). EDIT: We‚Äôve been together for over a decade and we‚Äôve lived together for half of that time. He got himself another apartment, so mentally that is very difficult for him.

I eat only canned/dry food since over a year also because I can't deal with the disinfecting and whatnot, so my S.O. graciously leaves my stuff and meds downstairs and I come pick it up later when it has sanitized. I take vitamin supplements but I'm still worried I have deficiencies.

I don't exercise because I barely have enough energy to eat.

I have recently read about the latest variant from South Africa, which could bypass current vaccines... I am about to have my third shot (immunocompromised people need 3 doses initially) and was about to finally come out of my cave, but now there's this? These variants will continue to emerge. If our country was saavy we'd close the borders again or keep mandatory quarantine for travellers. But no. They'll let this variant come in and then be like ""oH nO tHeRe iS cOmMuNitY tRaNsMiSsIoN dAmN"".

I'm not even depressed (I love my job and I keep my social contacts high and truly have the greatest S.O. and friends ever), but I'm simply *exhausted* and *mad*.

An *ideal* day for me would be simply being with my S.O. and eating a huge fresh crunchy salad, fresh fruits and any meal he cooked, and sleeping together.  
A *perfect* day would be this, but covid does not even *exist*.

The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa. Current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant. Several labs have indicated that for one widely used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation.

I wanted to take a moment to thank all of you for this community as It has helped me learn about my disease. I truly hope you're all well and able to have a good holiday season. Perhaps I'm delusional or in a brain fog but I've come to think of this subreddit as a safe place to vent my experience with living with lupus and truly express what my life is like.

I've just finished my first meal that I've been able to keep down after about a 60 hour period. I don't know if this is because of my lupus or not. The only other time I experienced this is during periods of extreme depression and/or anxiety. I do not have covid, so not sure what's going on there.

Anyhow, for that I am happy and want to tell you to *keep going*. Little victories make it all worth it sometimes. I read something yesterday that also made me happy, it was ""tomorrow doesn't exist."" For some reason that realization for me was just total bliss. Like, tomorrow has not happened yet, so the anxieties and depression that comes along with lupus have not happened yet.

I feel I'm ranting, so I'll wrap it up. I just wanted to post this so I could feel human and just be real. Sometimes lupus feels like a total dehumanization, and you should feel validated.

86,11,"Severe, ongoing lower back pain--no clear explanation. Ideas? I was diagnosed with lupus and APS at the end of August 2021. I don't want to assume every problem I have is due to lupus (in some way or another). I also know that lupus can cause a lot of different things and is different in different people. But ... is severe, chronic, low-back pain that doesn't respond to a lot of PT and core strengthening exercises err.... even at all common in lupus? Like, could it it be chronic inflammation of muscles in the lower back?

Details: Started in April. Varies in severity, but when it's real bad, I can't bend or even roll over. When I get it loosened, I can actually do a lot. I have always been into strength training and do a ton of core strength stuff. Went to PT just to make sure I wasn't missing anything--- they did all the stuff they would do for someone with disc issues. Didn't help even a little. Now doing a lot of yoga, somatic movement, stretching, trying to loosen those muscles as much as strengthen. No help.

I know I have two minor fissures in discs, but the PT said they should have been addressed by all the PT. And they are minor. 

It's both sides. Pain radiates down the legs sometimes. Nerves definitely involved.

My kidneys look fine so far, so I doubt it's that. 

I was supposed to get a colonoscopy earlier this year for other issues,  I guess when I do that I can see if there's any sort of polyp pressing on a nerve? (That seems extreme, though.)

Not sure what to do. Seeing a neurologist in January. Supposed to do the colonoscopy eventually.  This is starting to feel pretty urgent, but I don't know what the next step is.

But I guess my main question is whether this could just be severe inflammation and nerve irritation due to my body's autoimmune response. ANyone else experience anything like it?  Does lupus often manifest in severe inflammation of lower spine/back muscles?  I mean, maybe this doesn't even have to do with my lupus. I have no idea.

Joint pain for a day or two after (due to lower steroids) but I‚Äôm feeling a lot better now! My memory and recollection continues to improve every day. That‚Äôs been my biggest difference so far. (I‚Äôm remembering things/really old memories from 15+ years ago, it‚Äôs really cool!)


In terms of the booster: I felt shitty for a day and a half then I bounced back pretty quick! It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since my shot and I‚Äôm feeling great. Getting my flu shot next!


I hope you are all feeling the best you can and are taking care of yourselves! Love you all and I‚Äôm sending my love and strength your way!",General,1

93,30,"Have been on Plaquenil for almost a year and don‚Äôt feel any better. I started taking Plaquenil in December 2020 after symptoms and labs suggested I have SLE. It runs in my family big time so that was no surprise. My rheumatologist said my case was somewhat mild in that I had no organ involvement, rashes, or mouth sores. So she started me on Plaquenil 200mg. I still wasn‚Äôt feeling well 6 months later and she did labs and said all my inflammation levels had gone down and the medication was doing it‚Äôs thing and perhaps it was something else. Other tests suggested I had problems with hyperparathyroidism which can cause similar symptoms to lupus so I saw an endocrinologist and after more tests she ruled it out. 

So I‚Äôve made another appointment with my rheumatologist to get tested again. My biggest symptoms are the terrible fatigue and flu like feeling. I can sleep 10+ hours and still feel awful. I still don‚Äôt have rashes, or mouth sores, or bad pain. But this awful feeling of just being ILL has greatly limited my quality of life and what I‚Äôm able to do. I also work full time and go to school full time and I definitely feel stress is a trigger for these almost constant flares. 

I guess my question is‚Ä¶will I have to go on harsher meds even though my case is ‚Äúmild‚Äù? Would cutting out gluten, sugar, and dairy help? It‚Äôs just depressing because both my mom and aunt have lupus, don‚Äôt take any meds for it, can eat whatever, be out in the sun, and have way more energy than me and they‚Äôre in their late 60s!

98,10,"Have you had a healthy pregnancy with lupus? Please share. I was recently diagnosed with lupus, but my partner and I conceived before my labs came back, so by the time I was diagnosed, I was already pregnant. The rheumatologist didn‚Äôt seem super worried about it and prescribed me hydroxychloroquine. I made an appointment with a maternal fetal medicine specialist which is tomorrow. 

They initially tested me and found 1/160 ANAs and then I was referred to a rheumatologist who tested me for everything (dozens of tests I can‚Äôt even name.) My OB threw in some labs as well. I tested negative for everything the second time, including ANAs, except for very slight anti-dsdna antibodies. No smith antibodies, no anti-phospholipids, no protein in my urine. All my nutrient panels were ‚Äúimpressive‚Äù according to the doctor. My blood pressure is good and I‚Äôm generally athletic, except joint pain keeps me from running now. I have none of the classic symptoms of lupus except for joint pain. He still gave me a lupus diagnosis though. 

I read a lot of scholarly articles online that showed higher rates of miscarriage for lupus patients. I also saw that hydroxychloroquine can reduce miscarriage but increase birth defects. I also saw an increased risk in ASD, learning disabilities and lower IQ in children of lupus patients. 

I feel like the women in these cohorts probably had higher risk factors than I do though, as most people with lupus have more kinds of antibodies and higher amounts than I do. Am I kidding myself or am I rightfully reducing my anxiety? 

I just feel kind of sad and scared and I want to do everything right for my first child, at the same time I feel like I‚Äôm otherwise very healthy and shouldn‚Äôt have a complicated pregnancy. 

What was your lupus pregnancy like? Did you take hydroxychloroquine? Would you do anything differently?

Update: went to MFM yesterday, she started the meeting by saying ‚Äúyour baby is going to be fine.‚Äù She advised against taking plaquenil since I had very low disease activity and had never taken it before. Because my ANAs are currently negative she agreed that we shouldn‚Äôt treat something that isn‚Äôt there, but said if my joint pain comes back she‚Äôs going to recommend it.

I am a 20 year old female. Ever since I was about 13 years old I‚Äôve dealt with chronic fatigue and I easily get sick. Very often I would feel unwell, but could never explain why.  I‚Äôve always had red rashes on my face, not bumpy but super red and hot to the touch. I thought it was normal. I also dealt with heart palpitations on and off over the years, it comes in waves. 

Last month I developed a sudden high fever, severe headache and severe joint pain in my hips. I went to the ER thinking it was possibly covid; tested negative. They thought it was possibly meningitis, spinal tap was clear. My primary doctor ran a bunch of tests, ANA was positive and it said systemic lupus, Sj√∂gren‚Äôs syndrome, or systemic sclerosis.

My symptoms coincide with lupus, however I haven‚Äôt done much research on the other 2 diseases. My mom and grandma has lupus. I see a rheumatologist on Wednesday.

I‚Äôm worried because ever since that ‚Äúflare up‚Äù, I‚Äôve been feeling so much worse than I ever have over the years. I now get joint pain in my hips, fingers, ankles, elbows, knees and wrists. This has never happened up until a month ago. It‚Äôs progressively getting worse in the short time frame.  The pain has been almost putting me in tears. I have also been getting severe heart palpitations, much more often and severe than it‚Äôs ever been. Its getting to the point where I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe properly while it‚Äôs happening because my heart skips so many beats. I also keep feeling like I‚Äôm getting sick, but I never actually do. It happens every other week or so. I feel feverish and really run down. I‚Äôve also been frequently spotting, with no menstrual cramps what so ever. Not sure if that has anything to do with it. 

What‚Äôs really weird is that my ESR and CRP came back negative. How is my joint pain explained if they‚Äôre negative??

I pushed to get a second opinion from rheumatology (not protocol in this system). Thank goodness I did, although I don't think the new rheum was convinced anything was going on.

I nudged for some more labs, and had a positive reflex test for a lupus-specific antibody. 

So... I have some features pretty specific to RA, vs. some specific to SLE, with the general consensus being ""something is wrong"". I started meds, but have also started getting decimated by symptoms-- flares of joint pain/swelling/stiffness, fatigue so severe I can't get out of bed, an alarming lack of focus.

I got better for a short period, but then symptoms got worse than before. Pcp suggested maybe I had lupus and we did an ANA test that was positive. Then went to a rheumatologist to do more testing. 

I got the results for the Avise blood test on Monday and everything except my ANA was negative. The rheumatologist basically told me that he couldn't help me and to go back to the GI doctor or get a sleep study done to address the fatigue. Totally ignored the rest of my symptoms. It felt really demeaning and condescending how he spoke to me and he suggested I may have depression. 

I don't deny possibly being depressed after a year of dealing with these symptoms, especially the extreme fatigue, but I have never felt so dismissed and ignored. I'm so tired. I was excited to potentially have an answer to my misery and I feel like I have to start over again.

A few months after this my partner left me. This forced me to move back with my parents, the last thing I wanted due to our complicated history. 

I‚Äôve only gotten worse. I‚Äôve had countless hospital stays, my longest 29 days. I‚Äôm up to 13 surgeries. I do weekly methotrexate injections, 10 daily meds & monthly infusions. 

I‚Äôm still with my parents because I have nowhere else to go. I‚Äôm on SSDI and rent is very expensive here. I have five dogs, two from my grandpa that passed a few years ago. I couldn‚Äôt even find a place to allow that many dogs. I do all my own housework, yard work, cooking, and drive to my appointments. 

I‚Äôm on my second move with my parents now. They decided to build a new house during the pandemic. To do this we would have to live in separate rv trailers on the property. I told my dad I couldn‚Äôt do it when he asked. It‚Äôs already so hard for me to manage daily life in a 600 sq ft cottage (behind their house). My dad talked a big game how they‚Äôd help me with the dog walks and everything. I had no choice in the matter. December of 2020 we moved into trailers. My parents have a super nice 5th wheel with massive windows, a fireplace, king sized bed, double refrigerator. They bought me an old one that‚Äôs much smaller. It has small windows making it dark inside. There‚Äôs nowhere for me to sit w/feet up, the only position I can sit in, other than the bed. Obviously, no doggy door so I‚Äôm constantly letting dogs in or out. 

I can‚Äôt use the toilet in the trailer because my parents don‚Äôt want to pay for it to be dumped frequently. They rented an outhouse. I have GI problems & often have to walk out to it in the middle of the night. Pretty much everything is just harder in the trailer. 

It‚Äôs been almost a year now. During that time I‚Äôve had surgery, head to toe poison oak for weeks, tore 2 tendons in my ankle, and had a sinus infection that took 2 different courses of antibiotics to get rid of. 

Today I got in an argument w/my mom. It started because she said my dad couldn‚Äôt start the fence for the dogs until December 7th. I was a bit shocked by this and said I wished dad would‚Äôve let me pay for Lowe‚Äôs to do it back when I offered. She exploded at this. Screaming at me and in my face. She said they were in the exact same boat as me. I told her that they are nowhere near the same since I‚Äôm sick, have twice the dogs and half the trailer. 

She screamed at me that tens of thousands of people have worse diseases than me and in worse conditions. Then she said she‚Äôs sick all the time too and handles it fine. This is news to me as she only has two prescriptions and goes to the doc once a year. My dad said some people just don‚Äôt have the mental capacity for it. She said they are building me a cottage so stop complaining. Side note I told them a thousand times I would Live in their nice trailer, if it was hooked to sewer, so they didn‚Äôt have to build the cottage.

During my first pregnancy my Rheum had me go on Plaquenil to prevent heart block. It seemed to work as my son was born completely healthy. What concerned me is that all of my other doctors (Ob, High-risk OB) were very confused and alarmed as to why I was taking it since I didn‚Äôt have symptoms of Lupus or Sjogrens and Plaquenil isn‚Äôt 100% safe for pregnancy. It took a lot of rounds of my doctors calling each other to eventually be ok with me taking it.

Now, that could be. However a lot of the symptoms started well before anything that could link with AIH and frankly the liver enzyme numbers are not that wild (and a bunch of major symptoms missing but of course, symptoms missing for SLE as well like never had a rash)

Anyway, they seem to be preparing to immediately start medication following biopsy results. They have bloodwork to make sure azathioprine wont go south on me lined up.

My question is, I'd like a second opinion but its taken over a year to get this far, 


1.)how would one even rule out drug induce lupus? (my GI is an asshole and literally walked out of the room without answering my questions, he was pissed I had them and told me I probably had AIH and not to google it and the medicine would probably help after a few years)

2.) if azathioprine is started will it mess up the labs so that ruling out drug induced lupus wont even be possible?

Dr. Michelle Petri at Johns Hopkins has one of the largest lupus clinics in the world and studies her patients very very closely. She showed no increase #lupus flares after #COVID19  vaccine (228 patients) and lupus infections (31 patients tested). Anticardiolipin antibodies did increase after infection. 

Interestingly skin lupus (cutaneous lupus) tended to improve after infection.

However, antiphospholipid antibodies overall did not increase. This is important, as we know COVID infection can cause deadly blood clots (so not surprising). 

Overall, good news for lupus patients.

I don‚Äôt have any organ involvement and my blood cell counts are all good.  I‚Äôve had vitamin D deficiency and low wbc counts in the past but they‚Äôre good right now.

The package insert for HCQ says that ""pigmentation disorders"" may occur with plaquenil - thus the reason I suspect that plaquenil is playing a role here.

Forty five (36 of whom werefemale) were adults aged over 15. I have treatedthese patients with prednisolone 1 mg/kg andsymptomatic treatment (salt restriction anddiuretics) as required. The patients took this dosage of prednisolone for four to eight weeks,depending on their response and the occurrence ofside effects, before starting to taper the dose.During this period one of the nine men and 30 ofthe 36 women complained of muscle cramps,which were sometimes severe and incapacitating.Initially I thought that this could be related tosalt restriction and the use of diuretics withconsequent electrolyte imbalances. **The meanserum sodium concentration (over the first fourto eight weeks), however, was 136 mmol/ (range133-146 mmol/l) in the men and 133 mmolll(130-144 mmolIl) in the women.

It is a particular type of dizziness here's my best shot at describing it:

* The only trigger I've noticed is not getting enough sleep.
* I don't feel lightheaded or like I'm going to black out. No vision changes
* It doesn't feel like the sort of dizziness that comes with nausea. 
* I've had orthostatic hypotension in the past and this feels qualitatively different. Doesn't feel like low blood pressure. 
* I don't feel like I am off balance *from within*. Rather, it just feels like the floor is sinking. (I mean, obviously it is from within, it's not the damn floor. lol But the qualitative sensation makes it feel like it's the floor that is moving.

298,2,"The Importance of Posture You may have heard that good posture is essential for good health, but do you know why? Posture refers to how you position your body when you‚Äôre sitting, standing, or lying down. Your posture is the result of habits formed over the course of years.

Many people may recognize poor posture in others without realizing how their own falls short. If you look around at co-workers at the office, you‚Äôll likely find them hunched over at their desks. Learn why good posture matters ‚Äî and what you can do to improve yours.

What is good posture?
Good posture is the proper alignment of your body when standing or sitting. Correct positioning involves training yourself to hold your body against gravity with the least strain and tension on supportive structures, such as your muscles and ligaments. Proper posture keeps your bones and joints in optimal alignment and decreases wear and tear on supportive structures.

Good posture reduces back and neck pain
The proper alignment of your spine allows you to move easily so that your body supports your weight without strain. Poor posture can place stress on your tendons, muscles, and ligaments, leading to neck and back pain.

If you suffer from neck and back pain, it may surprise you to know that improving your posture may go a long way in easing your symptoms.

Poor posture impacts digestion
Slouching puts your body in an unnatural position that can impact certain abdominal organs. Stooping or hunching over at your desk or slouching while looking at your mobile device can interfere with proper digestion, increasing the risk for acid reflux and constipation.

If you notice that you get heartburn when slouching, something as simple as sitting up straight may bring relief.

Good posture improves muscle and joint function
When you use good posture, your muscles and other structures function properly, helping you to avoid abnormal wear and tear. Improper posture places stress on your joints and can cause them to wear away. This is the most common cause of osteoarthritis, a form of ‚Äúwear and tear‚Äù arthritis.

While other factors, such as age and genetics, can increase the risk of arthritis, the way you carry your body plays a role in how much stress you put on your joints. Keeping your body aligned in the proper posture can reduce muscle fatigue and strain and help keep your joints healthy and lubricated.

Proper posture boosts mood
When you think about factors that can improve your mood, posture likely isn‚Äôt the first thing to come to mind. Look at it this way: Your brain and body have two-way communication, meaning that your mood can impact your posture and your posture can affect your mood. When you‚Äôre happy, you may notice that you sit upright, and when you‚Äôre feeling down, you‚Äôre more likely to slouch or sit in a slumped position.

The next time you notice your mood sinking, try changing your posture; stand up straight, and take deep breaths. You may notice a gentle boost in mood after doing so.

Proper posture improves spine health
Good posture is one of the simplest and easiest ways to keep your spine healthy. While it may take some practice and mindfulness, using correct posture will provide the appropriate back support. This is especially important if you spend time sitting in an office chair or standing throughout the day.

Sitting and standing with proper alignment improves blood flow, helps keep your nerves and blood vessels healthy, and supports your muscles, ligaments, and tendons. People who make a habit of using correct posture are less likely to experience related back and neck pain.

For months I have been taking 8 mg Methylprednisolone, joint and muscle pain have gone.

In the middle of august I started taking HCQ 400, and after a month I got severe pain in my lower abdomen, pelvis,  scrotum, inner thigh (specially right side), my tummy was bloating. They pain could disappear in one place but start in another (for example after abdomen the pain could appear in right inner thigh). Also it is painful when you masturbate or after that.

The pain was so intense, painkillers and antispasmodics don't work, 3 times I visited ER in 3 different hospitals, 3 times they did a ultrasound and x-ray but couldn't find anything. CT of the genitourinary system didn't show anything either.

307,29,"I wanted to share something positive I (25f) was diagnosed with Lupus a little over six months ago. Aside from the muscle aches and pains, one of my most prolific symptoms was hair loss. 
I've always had very thick, bushy hair so losing it didn't feel like a problem for the longest time because it wasn't making a difference to the total amount of hair I had. I've never cared all that much about my hair and historically maybe don't take the best care of and certainly let it tangle. 
Lately however it's been tangling so much, despite increased hair care, and has become so brittle that untangling it results in chunks coming out. The last few weeks has been causing me so much anxiety as I wash my hair and come back with fistfuls of hair. I spent a week giving it a lot of extra time and effort and finally went to get a haircut yesterday.
The last time I got it cut (the only other time since my diagnosis) the stylist was somewhat hostile and seemed convinced that I butched a quarantine haircut I didn't want to own up to so when I had to embarrassingly say it was a medical condition that was causing the missing hair, she wouldn't believe me. I did not even like the haircut and left feeling pretty bad. 
Fast forward to yesterday and I REALLY didn't want to deal with something like that again so was dreading the haircut so much, but it was either chop it to a more manageable length or slowly pull all of my hair out.
Here comes the uplifting part because the woman who cut my hair was SO kind and careful. I had brushed out my hair that morning but there were definitely still a few tangles at the dying ends that she so slowly and gently brushed out with a comb. When she saw the particularly bad section of my hair, she didn't say anything and accepted when I simply said it was a medication side effect (white lie).

Social media was FINALLY enjoyable for me as well as an outlet for all of my suffering with lupus. I actually still text and stay in contact with some of the warriors on my personal page.

A few months ago someone stole one of my lupus posts and she would not take it down. A fellow lupus warrior and friend of mine is the one who pointed it out to me. It took relentless communication for her to finally take it down (I submitted a claim or whatever to make Instagram take it down, told her this, and then she finally took it down). Anyway - it might not sound like much to people or a big deal but I was broken after that and shut down my page. The girl who stole my picture has over 10k followers did not tag me or anything. I know stuff like this happens all the time but I felt violated when it was a picture of me getting an infusion and her claiming she didn't know who sent it to her?!

It put a bad taste in my mouth and now I am so nervous to go back to the community and be reminded that this could happen anytime.

My father passed away from SLE at 36. I had a urologist, nephrologist, and urogynocologist for almost the past five years who never gave me a reason for my chronic kidney. I‚Äôve had all different types of bloodwork done, scans, 24hr urines, diets, and collected many stones for testing for years. All I got from my nephrologist right before he retired earlier this year was ‚Äúit looks like you‚Äôre heading into stage 2 kidney disease‚Äù. I‚Äôve wanted to give up hope for a diagnosis/cause for a long time. However my PCP is a literal angel. He is the same doctor who diagnosed my dad with SLE when my dad was 22 and has all of my family‚Äôs medical history. He is the only doctor who has understood that I should get an ANA test and has been monitoring me for lupus symptoms since I was 16. I‚Äôve had more bad days than good the past two years and it‚Äôs getting worse. I just saw my PCP for my annual after getting over pneumonia for the second time this year. I told him all my newer weird symptoms and things that I felt sounded crazy. He previously sent me for two lupus tests but it has been over a year since my last one.

I got my blood done today and it has completely knocked me on my ass and I‚Äôm back into severe pain (flank, back, rash, fatigue, sciatica which is a recently new pain). I stopped counting after I saw 11 vials filled with blood as he ordered every test possible to rule out other immune issues.

Today has been a shit show of a day. Honestly, the past two years have been miserable health wise and consequently financially. I‚Äôve been on Cytoxan since June because nothing else worked. I got a call from my rheumatologist today with more bad news from recent blood work. My inflammation is really bad which is impacting my LFTs, joints, kidneys, colon, and brain. We‚Äôve been doing so much imaging and tests all around including a bone density test which shows that my osteoporosis is getting worse. A part of my tooth even cracked off which my rheum said is probably due to the osteoporosis and/or Sjogrens. 

Anyways, with all of this going down I started talking to my husband about where I want to draw the line. I calculated that I spend approximately 1/4th of the year hospitalized in the past 3 years (when the worst flare up I‚Äôve ever had started). This doesn‚Äôt even include doctors‚Äô appointments, scheduled imaging (MRIs, CTs, ultrasound, etc.), infusions, or even blood work. If I had a full time job there is no possible way I‚Äôve be able to do any of this. My veins are also started to get really messed up as every week I‚Äôm poked at least twice. I look like a fucking junkie. 

With all that being said and done, I told my husband that if the cytoxan doesn‚Äôt work and my quality of life continues to diminish that I want out. I want to stop all treatment, stick with pain management, and just succumb to this disease. This ‚Äúquality of life‚Äù isn‚Äôt living and it truly feels like there‚Äôs no coming back from it. I spoke to my pain management doctor as well and asked his opinion (throughout the year we‚Äôve become very close and not only does he know everything about my medical history, but he‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm able to walk for almost 20 minutes, so I trust him more than any other doctor). He said that at the very least to take prednisone and/or Plaquenil (prednisone caused osteoporosis and Plaquenil didn‚Äôt work), so that he could justify prescribing my pain medication and to continue getting evaluated to monitor my health. He understood me not wanting to try more nuclear treatments, but encouraged me to take more mild medication for all my AIs. 

I know I can‚Äôt be the only one out there who feels like they‚Äôve had enough of all the testing, side effects, hospital visits, lack of a decent quality life, and just being tired of this in general knowing that it‚Äôs chronic. Forever. For the foreseeable future, we‚Äôll never be cured. The best we can hope for is remission. So, where do you guys draw the line? At that point have you decided that you can‚Äôt continue like this and just want a break from all the doctors and treatments? Please don‚Äôt misunderstand because by no means am I suggesting, thinking, or talking about suicide. This is purely just stopping treatment, which I understand can very well lead to death, but I am not talking about ending my life by any means.

This is my fourth post to this sub in three days. It will also, very likely, be my fourth post on this sub I completely abandon. I don't know what I need and I don't know what I want. I do, however, know that I am stuck in this nasty cycle of shortness of breath, unabashed terror, worsening chest pain and shortness of breath, self-led research and education, and finally back to unabashed terror. 

I am married with children. My husband is not health literate. Even if I did explain the situation, there is no shared understanding of what our future may look like. My only other form of familial support comes from my maternal grandmother who is battling alzheimers. 

I've never been one for self-pity, in fact, I have always felt so grateful that I received a diagnosis because the alternative means both living with symptoms of a disease and having no answers. It has only been recently that I realized how really unfair this process has been. I hate that my neighbor is a 50 something female who has been an admitted meth addict since the 1980s, obsessively uses tanning beds, smokes a pack-a-day on top of her pot habit, and has only ever needed to see a doctor for the occasional sexually transmitted disease. 

I am 30, sitting here with every symptom of heart failure. I've done everything right. I took the abuse and got diagnosed. I've taken all the drugs, kept on top of my labs and appointments. I joined clinical trials. I have a neat collection of hats and SPF 50 shirts. I obsessively wear sunscreen, I use blue light filters and led lighting. I don't drink, smoke, or do meth. I don't sit too long, I eat fruit, excersie, and have been to church. Why am I still sick? Why is my disease still progressing? 

What I think is the worst about it all is the symptom that isn't really a symptom-- the impending sense of doom. It's so strange, kind of like anxiety that isn't anxious at all. It's like the subconscious knows that your body is dying. I've only had it one other time, way back when my breathing problems first started, presenting as some pretty intense pneumonia. I've been having dreams that accompany the doom. Last week. I had a dream that I was having a heart attack.  I was walking around with chest cramping and breathing difficulties. I had asked my husband to call 911 and he ignored me saying that he was going to run an errand. I was trying to figure out how to get myself to the hospital when I woke up from the dream with some pretty intense muscle cramping in the center of my chest. 

While I am a very big advocate for therapy for other people, I have been neglecting myself. A while ago. I decided this was too much and scheduled an appointment. I still have awhile to wait, but am so glad I finally  committed myself to go. I also have an appointment tomorrow for a CT and results of my echocardiogram.

356,6,"Concern about interstitial lung disease/pulmonary fibrosis. Steroids to test for active inflammation? I am seeing a pulmonologist today. I think I have pleurisy, but my bigger concern is that I suspect that I have interstitial lung disease. I have slowly developed shortness of breath during exertion over the last few years along with a dry cough. It feels the way ILD is described. I am really hoping there is no permanent scarring.  Anyway,  I read (in the Lupus Encyclopedia)  u/LupusEncyclopedia that if active inflammation of the interstitial tissue doesn't show up on a CT scan or other test, a round of steroids may be used as a test--basically, see if the problem improves with steroid use. While I really don't want to be on steroids, I may suggest this if the tests don't turn up anything. (I had a CT scan after a blood clot recently and no abnormalities were noted. I think that if I do have inflammation of the interstitial tissue, it's minor. But I want to catch it before it gets worse or causes scarring).

Anyone know how long one needs to be on steroids to tell if the SOB and coughing is due to ILD? And whether it's a high dose?

Also, for those of you who have had ILD and active inflammation: What has worked?

Thank you!

\*Update: Lung scan was clear, although the DLOC was slightly abnormal. Pulmonologist diagnosed costochondritis and said maybe pleurisy, but definitely no ILD. That is a huge relief, but the coughing and shortness of breath is still a mystery. Rheum wants me to see ENT for possible vocal chord dysfunction, but I don't know that this would explain the symptoms. Need to see GI to follow-up about possible silent reflux cause.

I was in tears at having a diagnosis finally, and not feeling like I was just going crazy.

I I've been in what I assume is a bad flare for the past 2 weeks and just can't for the life of me wake up and function at all. I live with my partner and my parents,and I feel awful when Im sick and can't be up and with everyone, and last night my mom flat out told me I was using lupus as an excuse to do nothing and said I don't spend any time with anyone and only care about myself. I just lost it. I feel guilty for all these things already, and then she says all the things I was worried everyone was thinking. The diagnosis was hard, and I've felt alone, and didn't need to hear that. 
Anyway, I honestly just needed to rant a little, and hope for some people who know how this works.

Most of the information is in the document I've shared ( [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LhQEf9akqFfxXWqIizyO1yF8VN\_3tjEr/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LhQEf9akqFfxXWqIizyO1yF8VN_3tjEr/view?usp=sharing) ) but to give as concise a background as possible:

Age: 20

Sex: F

Weight: 165

Height: 5'0

Race: White Hispanic (Spain)

Country: USA

No existing medical conditions, no current medications, no drug use, no smoking. Edit: forgot to mention I‚Äôm autistic.

\-Started college Sep 2019; started experiencing heart palpitations. Saw cardiologist, they said my heart looked fine and it was probably anxiety since I go to school in a city which was a big change for me. These have mostly subsided; I went from back then having multiple a day to now having them maybe one or twice a month IF that.

\-March 2020 moved back home for the pandemic; did online school the remainder of that semester, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021.

\-Went through a LOT of very intense trauma August, October, and November 2020, as well as some more smaller things occurring throughout the rest of the winter. This is when I was feeling nauseous, temp dysregulation, anxiety, pretty much every night. Most of these symptoms are a LOT better now, if not disappeared. If I didn't go to sleep early enough, I would be plagued with extreme nausea, whole body shivering/shaking, chills, intense anxiety, that didn't go away for at least an hour if not more.

\-Moved back to college at the end of August 2021 (about a month and a half ago). This was very good for my mental health and I am mentally doing a lot better than I was for the previous year and a half before that; home is not a very happy place for me.

\-I still have temp dysregulation, but those nights upon nights of just feeling physically ill are a thing of the past. Nausea, chills, shivering/shaking are rare. I do still get headaches from time to time though.

\-Lexapro helped my anxiety but made me gain weight, so I switched to Prozac. Both going on and off Lexapro, as well as going on and off of Prozac made those feelings of ""nighttime sickness"" as well as dissociation and anxiety VERY bad. Maybe the worst they've ever been.

\-I am fully vaccinated and have never had COVID.

\-Non-listed hormones are normal; autoimmune panel was normal; thyroid levels are all normal; rest of metabolic panel and CBC are normal.

\-Most recent bloodwork is from an Endocrinology appointment; recommendations from Dr included: Multivitamin w/ iron + birth control for anemia (I have heavy periods off BC); BECAUSE for painful ovulation and cystic acne; anti-inflammatory diet (gluten + dairy free) for elevated CRP and ESR; BECAUSE and/or weight loss for elevated DHEAS; Metformin and/or Wellbutrin or Phentermine for weight loss.

My biggest concern is that she is just treating the symptoms (anemia, inflammation) when they could be related and have a more serious underlying cause.

Please don't give judgement about the starting and stopping of birth control so much; I am aware that in and of itself is not good for me, but my mother kept trying to scare me out of taking it by doing very sketchy research and bombarding me with it until I changed my mind.

If you have any other questions about other labs or anything like that I can look it up and tell you; I have at the very least a CBC for most of the dates listed in the document.",Advice,0

426,3,"Those with a lupus diagnosis AND fibromyalgia diagnosis, can you please tell us about your story? how did you get DXed with fibro? What came first? Does a rheumatologist treat your lupus + fibromyalgia together? Hi there, sorry for the long text wall ahead of time. *I've had SLE lupus with nephritis since 2007, been through multiple flares in that time.* 

However, I'm beginning to think I have fibro on top of systemic lupus. And I'm hoping to get some advice from you all.

 I've mentioned the below stuff to my rheumy two times before but was blown off; he said it could be neuropathy (the shooting pains) but that's it. I haven't pushed or advocated very hard because I feel like ""oh it's just lupus"" but at the end of the day, I've had lupus for 10+ years before any of the below  symptoms started. Also, my lupus is getting better, except for a few very specific symptoms 

**So my question:** if you have lupus and THEN got a fibro diagnosis, how did you navigate the journey? How did you get your rheumatologist to listen, and not dismiss that it's lupus? What do they test for if you have fibro symptoms while also having lupus? Do the below symptoms sound similar to fibro? 

STORY:

In 2016, after several years of remission, I got a c.diff infection that triggered a lupus flare. In 2017, I started dealing with different pain than ever before -- it was also a time that i was HIGHLY stressed (moved across the country, first job out of college, got dumped by my best friend, had relationships issues, my uncle passed away, etc).  

Now in 2021,  the vast majority  of my lupus symptoms (arthritis/ulcers/hair loss/nephritis) have ALL stabilized/almost gone after a year of Benlysta. But I'm still dealing with the below symptoms to no relief. Examples below:

1. Shooting / electric-like pains that migrate all over my body; usually the ""zap"" lasts 30-60 seconds and goes somewhere else. It's not every day, but almost everyday. They are ALL over my body. 
2. When I get over tired, my legs/body are restless + almost like ""crawling out of skin"" feeling. Ex: when laying down on the couch, and my fiance is stroking my arm, after 1 or 2 minutes, my skin feels painful/uncomfortable and i have to tell him to stop touching my arm or touch somewhere else on my body.   
3. I've had chronic left shoulder blade pain for 4+ years; it's aggravated by stress/emotions. I've had multiple scans done + it shows nothing. The pain can be debilitating and even stretches down to my hands/fingers when it's happening. 
   1.  I also have chronic pain in my lower hips/butt night, *only at night*. I'm thinking with the hip pain + shoulder blade pain, it's maybe  the ""tender spots"" mentioned in fibro ?
4. Finally, my **sleep** has been extremely bad for the past year - I always wake up aching and my hips hurt in the middle of the night. I never had this before until the last year or so. Also, my fitbit (which I got in December 2020) shows that I get less than 10% of deep sleep EVERY night for over a year. I have never gotten more than 1 hr of deep sleep for a year.

I get there and climb up on the table without peeing on myself. 10 minutes into the scan and having the tech pushing down on my bladder she says she can't find my left ovary (it's happened before). So she tells me to partially empty my bladder. Kinda hard to stop yourself when peeing but I managed it. I climbed back up on the table and we started again. 10 minutes later she still can't find my stupid ovary. So she tells me to fully empty my bladder (thank God). After another 10 minutes and pushing the prob down hard she finds my ovary tucked behind my uterus. Test gets over and done with and I leave the office. Few minutes into my drive my flare up starts and my stomach is sore to the touch. I get home and get an email with my results summary. They found a 13mm cyst on my right ovary but nothing else out of the ordinary. My back is tender as well from the table. All that for an inconclusive test.

A month later after drinking had pink urine and have had it since after drinking. I don't have any pain related to any type of kidney/bladder pain.


I have spurs in my neck so I have also had neck and arm (shoulder/elbow/wrist) pain. It could be due to a pinched nerve too. I seem to get flare-ups when I'm inactive as my job is in construction and as long as I'm moving around and not sitting I'm fine almost all of the time. My left elbow developed bursitis (I'm right handed) a little over a month ago out of nowhere. It was getting better and swelled back up a week ago and now is almost back to normal. My PCP prescribed Meloxicam and I think that helped. He also referred me to a osteopath. Also had more bloodwork and it only showed a slight infection which I have been battling a bronchitis with clear mucus so that might be why.


I also have a butterfly rash which I thought was from the heat. It's been super hot this summer and I sweat a lot. Like a lot. But it's just red. And I'm pretty sure I'm dehydrated as I have been drinking much less water than I used to. We lost our house in June due to a fire and have been staying with a friend.

Genuine question: How is it possible to have any level of anti-dsdna and be healthy/not have lupus? 

Background: My mom passed away due to lupus complications in her late 40s. She was in the hospital due to kidney issues and got a MRSA infection that went septic and killed her. 

A few years ago I started having symptoms similar to lupus and other autoimmune diseases, due to my family history, I was able to get into a rheumatologist fairly quickly and got lots of testing done. I had positive RF, antiCCP, and permanent joint damage that showed up on ultrasounds.  I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I also have a family history of RA so that didn't surprise me. Honestly, after watching Lupus take my mom away from me when I was still a teenager, I was relieved to have only have RA because I was so afraid of getting Lupus myself. 

Recently I have been having symptoms that more align with Lupus than RA (and I know it's possible to have both) so I am just curious. I have always tested negative for ANA screen. I have tested 3 times and the most recent time was about a year and a half ago. I was looking at old lab work and I saw that I had a low, but not positive amount of anti-dsdna? My level was 2 and I think the weak positive range starts at 20? I am curious as to how it's possible to have a low amount of antibodies, but not have the actual disease? My thought is that it's like if you have fought an infection previously but it is not active you would still have a low amount of the antibodies for that virus. Would that mean it's possible that I once had a higher level during a flare? I have been told that it's possible that I got that small amount of antibodies from my mom because she had been diagnosed with Lupus long before she got pregnant with me?

And I also want to be able to pursue a good career and make money to support my family and myself.....but I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to do anything with this body of mine. It literally affects every aspect of my life, it‚Äôs like some ripple effect. Example, restricts me financially ‚áí  need money to live and be happy. 

BTW I recently graduated high school and my gap year became more than just a year. Right now I‚Äôm trying to get my driver‚Äôs license but these lupus symptoms make me think I‚Äôll be a danger on the road and shouldn‚Äôt even bother driving. Stiff joints, locked joints, cold hands and feet and tingling from poor circulation, sudden itchiness that I can‚Äôt ignore, coughing fits and dry throats, sore all over, weak strength, and low energy that even full 8 hours of sleep can‚Äôt help. My health rapidly declined once the first lockdown began since my physical activity diminished from staying at home in my 1-bedroom apartment and also because I hadn‚Äôt taken my medicines for 1.5 years. Since then, everyday I randomly get coughing fits where my throat suddenly feels dry and I‚Äôm coughing to the point that I‚Äôm gagging and burping with watery eyes. I really don‚Äôt want to meet anyone and have them see me do that, especially during this pandemic. On top of that, I keep breaking out into hives that are unbearably itchy and burn so I‚Äôm scratching myself or just rubbing the area so I don‚Äôt tear my skin. How am I supposed to live my life like this. I can ignore the blue fingers and bald patches on my head, but not the coughing and itchiness that literally make me have to pause whatever I‚Äôm doing with no warning at all. 

I think the best solution for me is to take advantage of the opportunity I have to be able to **attend school online**, especially as more and more **WorkFromHome** jobs are becoming available. But imagine if I didn‚Äôt have a fussy autoimmune disease. I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about this stuff at all, I‚Äôd be free to live my life how I want it and not restricted by my own body. I hope I get better. I hope I don‚Äôt have live like this until I die.

Background- I‚Äôm a 35 year old female. I started getting a recurring face rash in early 2021 and the dermatologist ordered the ANA test because he suspected it might be a lupus rash and the test was positive (he called it a ‚Äúmild positive‚Äù).

The earliest appointment I could get with a local rheumatologist who takes my insurance is several months away, so until then I‚Äôm working with a nutritionist to try managing the symptoms with diet. My question is, what should I expect from the rheumatologist appointment as far as further testing she will order, preparation I should do before the exam, etc?

Some people seriously obsess over ALTs and ASTs in the 40s even when they have no health problems and say how they are going to die young. Like, what??? No doctor would tell you that! 

Sometimes I see posts about people freaking out because they got a ‚Äúweird rash‚Äù (right after having been in the sun all day) and that it *must* be cancer and that it‚Äôs impossible for it to be a simple sun burn. It‚Äôs as if people *want* to get diagnosed with something and are looking for any excuse to find something wrong. 

Then there are those who *have* been diagnosed with mild cases of some acute condition, but swear it means they‚Äôre now and forever disabled. Then they ask how to get handicap passes for parking even if it has nothing to do with their ability to walk, they‚Äôre ability to be in the sun for longer than 5 minutes, or anything that‚Äôs an actual real reason for needing it. No, Karen, having a UTI doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt walk. You might have to take some pain meds and antibiotics at most, but I‚Äôm pretty sure you can walk an extra ten steps instead of parking in handicap. 

My favorites though are the self-diagnosing posts with vague symptoms and no proof. I try to never comment on those because they usually have already made up their mind and can‚Äôt be convinced that without seeing specialists, they do not officially have anything. I‚Äôm talking about the people who *know in their gut* that they are chronically or terminally ill, yet refuse to see a doctor. 

I want to sympathize like I did before, I really do. But after being tested like a guinea pig, having real medical diagnoses, taking medicine that keeps me alive and functioning as much as it can, feeling and having real symptoms (not sun burns or literally a dot on my hand), I just can‚Äôt anymore. I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt have a right to worry because every illness starts somewhere. I‚Äôm saying they need to use common sense. If they went to a concert and screamed all night, the sore throat they have probably isn‚Äôt a death sentence.

520,12,"Feeling like giving up Hey guys. So I‚Äôve been mostly reading the comments on this thread for a few days, but I Wana share my story. This has probably been the hardest experience of my life.
About a year ago I started getting weird symptoms. My knees would swell up life grapefruits and my fingers looked like sausages. The joints in my hands and elbows were so stiff that I couldn‚Äôt straighten my arms. Then the fatigue started. I was so tired I couldn‚Äôt cook or eat. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and I went all the way at down to 105lb. Everything I ate bothered my stomach or made things worse. My lymph nodes were so swollen in my boobs chest and neck that they looked like huge grapes under my skin. I got a rash that started INSIDE my fucking ears and spread onto my face. During this time I got divorced (thank god my ex husband is an angel and is still loving and a good friend). The stress of the divorce still made things worse tho.
I started getting recurrent infections and was ok antibiotics for a month and a half straight, that‚Äôs when the light sensitivity started. The day after my 24th birthday I got a horrendous migraine. I literally could move my head. I was in the hospital for a week and they ran all my tests. They diagnosed me with lupus and said it was such a classic case that they had medical students coming into my room to study me which was great for them but annoying as fuck for me. I was in so much pain and so sensitive to light I had to wear shades even at night because the hospital lights were causing excruciating pain. It‚Äôs been a rocky road. My diagnosis was 6 months ago. As I‚Äôm writing this, my eyebrows have fallen out, and I dealt with hair loss. Some natural remedies have worked for the hair loss thank god, but my brows are terrible. I‚Äôm skinny and exhausted, and I live in Houston where being skinny is NOT it. People comment negatively about my weight all the time. 
My neck ears and scalp are covered in a painful itchy rash and I‚Äôm just exhausted, sad and tired of this shit already. I don‚Äôt date anymore right now because aside from
Still needing healing, the stress of my rebound cheating on me (after my divorce) made my symptoms so much worse that I don‚Äôt want to go through that again. I just quit my job bc my boss was NOT sympathetic and didn‚Äôt understand my symptoms at all. Thank god I have student loans. I‚Äôm a PHD student and that‚Äôs the only thing keeping me going rn.

For the last 4 months I have had:
- Quite severe joint pains
- Extreme Fatigue
- Frequent Mouth Ulcers
- Rash Across the face
- Hair Loss 
- Headaches
- Confusion
- Dizziness

I went to my doctor who referred me to a Rhumatologist. He thought it was lupus so he ordered some bloods. My ANA was negative. As were pretty much all the other tests other than my ESR which was very slightly raised at 20. My Rhumatologist told me it couldn't be lupus because my ANA was negative, however other GP's have told me you don't need a positive ANA. I did have some abnormal liver function tests however they have returned to normal and the doctor thinks it may have been due to a medication I was on.

In my family there are a few auto immune conditions. My dad has psoriasis and RA. My cousin has psoriasis and RA. My great grandad had type 1 diabetes and my great grandmother had RA. 

So far none of the doctor's really know what to do with me and just seem to be sending me around to other doctors who also don't know what to do. 

Is it possible that I have lupus???

(Also have a question about blood tests. On multiple websites it says that people with lupus who test negative for ANA commonly test positive for Anti-Ro and Anti-La antibodies. However aren't these a type of ENA? And isn't ENA a type of ANA or am I mistaken. I don't understand how you could test negative for ANA but positive for a type of ENA. I was also supposed to be have an ENA test however I never received the results. I assumed this was because my ANA was negative.)",Advice,0

I went to a primary care nurse practitioner in the clinic the other day because that was my only option. She told me what I‚Äôm describing could be fibromyalgia or lupus and gave me a shot of Ketorolac. Then did my labs. I asked if the shot would effect my inflammation lab results and they said no‚Ä¶ is was the sed rate ESR test. Ketorolac brought me down to almost normal and I looked like myself again. I got my lab results today and she said ‚Äúlabs look good eat a healthy diet and exercise.‚Äù üôÑ I just feel like I‚Äôm not being taken seriously because I‚Äôm 27. The only thing that came back is that my vitamin d levels are low 17.9 ANA and RF were negative. She wouldn‚Äôt give me a referral for a rheum. I read that vitamin d deficiency can cause some of what I was going through but it doesn‚Äôt seem like that‚Äôs all it is.

What do I do now?? Anyone else have ‚Äúnormal‚Äù labs and get totally dismissed? Anyone experience anything like what I went through?

This past year I developed cotton wool spots in one eye, which specialists suggest HAS to come from systemic disease, debilitating brain fog and fatigue, bilateral nerve pain that does not correlate to a known disc herniation, mouth infection/ulcers, muscle spasms, back and knee pain (no swelling), Raynaud‚Äôs and nail bed capillary dilation, dizziness and vertigo, to name just a few.

609,51,"Little tips After a few years of this diagnosis (with a lifetime to go woo), I realized I've amassed a couple of small tips to deal with the practical aspects of living with this disease. Hopefully they're not too obvious:

1. If you're on hydroxychloroquine, set up large text and text-to-speech reading on your phone in the accessibility settings before you go in for your retinal scans so that you can still read your messages after they dilate your pupils.
2. If you need to file an appeal with your insurance, save the letter in a separate document to reuse next time they give you grief. Also ask for carbon copies of all of your referrals/labs/scans (instead of one doctor just sending them straight to another) and file them on your computer or in an accordion in case one of your referrals/pre-auths \*mysteriously\* goes missing.
3. Drink several glasses of water one hour before your appointment, so that it's perfectly timed for urine samples and your veins are ready for blood draw.
4. Track your symptoms and/or their triggers with an app like Symple and use the export function to create a .CSV for your doctor or yourself to recognize patterns.
5. Plan to get yourself a little treat after every appointment so there's something positive to look forward to when you're feeling anxious. :)

620,6,"Struggling with mental and emotional issues I have had lupus since 2014 and managed it pretty well until last year when the pandemic hit. The unknown nature of COVID paired with the constant bickering of my parents caused it to flare up. Background: I moved in with my parents 1 yr (from the US to India) after the diagnosis to manage my condition and live the life I wanted. 

They always had a rocky relationship but they made it work for us children. They'd bicker about each other to me every time because I was just there. They'd involve me in their fights for no reason. Before covid, I could brush it aside, travel, and have other ways to vent my frustration. BTW, we have for years told them to get a divorce but they keep ""postponing"" it. But stuck in a lockdown with compromised immunity meant I couldn't really go anywhere. So in 28 yrs of my life, for the first time, I had a mental breakdown so big I was numb and shaken for days. I was yelling so loudly at 1 am in the morning that I could not even feel the air in my lungs. One great thing that came out of it was I made them KNOW how they have hurt me all my life by not considering my feelings EVER, and that even after knowing about my condition, they continued their circus. Since then I have made it a point they know they cannot think of me as a sounding board or their fucking therapist. 

Now their interactions are mellowed out, and I do not entertain their issues with each other. If, after 30 yrs of marriage, they're still together then they fucking better know they have made peace with how their relationship is and not project that onto others. And the hilarious part is they still have the balls to keep pushing me to get married. After seeing this kind of disaster and having lupus, how in the world do they think they're in a position to say that? 

Adding covid + lupus flare-up to the mix, my emotional well-being has been at the lowest. At first, I couldn't really understand what it was, but through therapy, I understood I was feeling emptiness, unhappiness, and hopelessness. And it kept coming back more frequently which scared me more. And since a few weeks, the frequency of 'I just don't know how I'm going to get through this' increased more and more. Again, I broke down during therapy a few days back because I realized **what I was going through wasn't like me**, and that for me is the scariest thing.

We will no longer be attending family events at their home, as it is not safe for me or him (he also has an autoimmune disease). Along with their shenanigans and all the stress of making so many decisions in such a short period of time, the stress started to get to me. I also suffer from non-epileptic seizures and thought I was handling the stress well because I was not having seizures regularly.

Dermatologist ordered blood work and I had negative ANA and ssb, but positive ssa. She put me on HCQ and tacrolimus ointment and referred me to a rheumatologist. However, before starting HCQ she had me get some baseline labs done. All were normal except my liver and kidney tests came back elevated, but not horribly so. Important to note, for this conversation, that my platelet count was within normal range (146), but just barely.

Two months after starting the HCQ (and my body feeling better than it has in a long time) I finally see the Rheumatologist. We met for over an hour, walking through every symptom and possibility. He felt pretty confident that I had Lupus, but wanted a full work up (like 30+ blood tests, x rays, etc). Everything came back negative including SSA, and the liver and kidney tests which were previously positive. I take that as a sign that HCQ is helping. However, my platelet count is now lower, just barely below normal range at 137.

The rheumatologist is now concerned that there might be a blood disorder involved as well. He wants a hematologist to rule that out before going further with other medications for lupus. Totally understand and I'm fine with that. I have an appointment with a hematologist next week. But I have read that low platelet count can happen with lupus so I'm confused why he seemed especially concerned.

Throughout all this, my malar rash has shown no improvement which the dermatologist was a bit surprised about. And in general, I don't think I feel horrible like I see most people on here talk about. I'm sometimes tired, but I'm also a night owl so that's my own doing. My body hurts, but it's not debilitating.

I was diagnosed with JRA at the age of 2 and have had joint pain all my life, starting in my knees and spreading to almost every joint, including my fingers, wrists, elbows, TMJ, shoulders, hips, toes, and ankles. I started with just methotrexate early on and quickly progressed to the triple therapy of methotrexate, plaquenil and sulfasalazine, which I‚Äôve been maintaining for a long time. I had unexplained fatigue and muscle pains that I thought were just because of my sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet. 

I am now 26 and was very recently diagnosed with Lupus after switching doctors and having extensive lab work and X-rays done for the first time in years. My flare-ups had been increasing in frequency and severity since the beginning of last year. I‚Äôm now on a steady stream of prednisone that I need to function normally. I was just pre-authorized to start Benlysta, but am concerned about potential side effects.

649,2,"Lupus symptoms/flare? Hi everyone! I‚Äôve been a lurker here for the last few months of my symptoms becoming increasingly more suspicious of lupus, so it‚Äôs gonna be a bit of a long winded post.

I have historically had chronic sinus infections, ear infections and tonsil infections my entire life. I have spent the last ~3 years working on getting a diagnosis for Ankylosing Spondylitis, which finally, after a lot of fighting with lots of different doctors, we determined I do have. I was put on Humira initially and I started getting tonsil infections 2-5 times a month, along with severe eye inflammation where my left eye would swell shut, have a burning/stabbing pain and my vision would go blurry for weeks at a time. Humira also severely messed up my period and caused pseudo PCOS symptoms, so it was a very detrimental medication that I had to come off of, despite it having life changing effects for me as far as mitigating my pain and fatigue 100%. I was then switched to Cosentyx and although it is still helping the AS in my spine, it is doing absolutely nothing for me in regards to my other symptoms. I have such severe fatigue that came back as soon as I discontinued the Humira, to the point of me barely being able to drag myself out of bed, some days.

Anyway! So it has been determined that I for sure have AS, that is fine. All of my bloodwork came back positive for AS. I have always suspected lupus in the back of my mind over the last several years of this journey due to a butterfly rash I get on my face every day that I have had since I was a kid, especially after spending more than 2 minutes in the sun. It gets particularly bad after showers as well. I have been treated for rosacea and given steroids and metronidazole cream to no avail. I‚Äôve also had:
‚Ä¢severe breathing trouble and chronic costochondritis for over a year that flares up periodically and will last months at a time
‚Ä¢photosensitivity all over my body but mainly on my hands, legs, feet and shoulders (and face) after spending more than 2 minutes in the sun
‚Ä¢debilitating joint pain in my toes despite testing negative for rheumatoid
‚Ä¢massive swelling in my hands and feet every day
‚Ä¢left eye blurryness and swelling with stabbing burning pain that happens every month for seemingly no reason other than flaring super badly
‚Ä¢massive amounts of hair loss as well as split ends and dry/brittleness that will happen literally a week after a massive haircut to mitigate split ends

My ANA came back 1:160 fine, speckled and my PCP said I also had a previously positive ANA, but other bloodwork checking for sjorgens(?) and other lupus markers came back negative. I did, however, go in to get those labs drawn when I was feeling pretty good and had very minimal pain. For the last week, I have been in the worst flare I‚Äôve ever experienced with a tonsil infection that has gone down to my neck lymph nodes and Eustachian tube, and I could literally feel my eye stabbing and burning yesterday. I went in to recheck all of my lab work because I literally felt like death yesterday, so I‚Äôm hoping it will yield some more clear results this time. I am curious if all of these symptoms coincide with those of you who have been positively diagnosed with lupus, especially the eye swelling and hurting with blurry vision? These infections regularly afflict me to the point of me going for a tonsillectomy beginning of October, so I am also curious if lupus leaves people vulnerable to these sorts of infections frequently?

650,4,"Persistent Pericarditis & Pleurisy despite blood test indicating decrease in inflammation... Is Azathioprine appropriate at this time? TL;DR

My C-Reactive protein levels have abruptly gone from high (30-40mg/L) to low (3.1mg/L), but I am still having issues with pericarditis and pleurisy. Why is this? My doctor wants me to take Azathioprine despite the low C-Reactive protein levels, and I'm feeling quite hesitant.  Will the pericarditis and pleurisy resolve without immunosuppressants now that my CRP is down? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry for writing a novel here..Really having some problems figuring out what to do right now. I've had SLE for about a year, and have taken prednisone & hydroxychloroquine since diagnosis. The blood tests this entire time have indicated inflammation, with C-Reactive protein constantly between 30-40 mg/L. There has also been significant inflammation in the heart and lungs, causing pericarditis and pleurisy. I tried methotrexate 3 months ago, but was unable to continue it because my ALT levels were getting quite high.Fast forward to last month.. Switched to a vegan diet in early August, and in mid August I decided to try Azathioprine. 2 weeks after starting the Azathioprine, I have a blood test done with my C-Reactive Protein was 3.1 mg/L. It has never been this low. Two weeks simply doesn't seem like enough time for the azathioprine to be effective. Diet is the only variable that changed in this time, I'm wondering if that can account for the decrease in inflammation.Despite the blood test results, I'm still experiencing pericarditis and pleurisy, although I'm at a much lower dose of Prednisone (15mg) now, compared to before (40mg). I decided to temporarily stop the Azathioprine last weekend due to relatively new severe point-specific & pressure headaches, and heart palpitations. Sunday night, it literally felt like the top of my head was caving in, and that was the last time I took the Azathioprine. I'm not entirely sure if these problems can be linked to Azathioprine, but it was the only variable that changed since these events began taking place.I'm really torn on whether or not I should continue to take the azathioprine, not only because of the potential side effects, but because my inflammation appears to be down. Although, I don't understand why my pericarditis and pleurisy are still prevalent. I'm wondering will the pericarditis and pleurisy resolve with time, or do I absolutely need immunosuppressants?

I‚Äôve had one partial bowel obstruction, and later an ileus that they caught and turned around before another obstruction formed. I also have had a ton of stomach pain, nausea, trouble with bowel movements and vomiting. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is relevant or not, but I‚Äôve also had 3 positive D - dimer tests in a row ( spaced out ) that each time the hospital couldn‚Äôt tell what the cause was, since there was no clot or any evidence of clots that had dislodged or anything.

673,6,"Low WBC Hello,

I have had well-controlled lupus for over 20 years (diagnosed as a teen). I was able to be unmedicated until about 7 years ago, when I started plaquenil, which has completely kept my main symptoms‚Äîmostly terrible joint pain and swelling and fatigue‚Äîat bay. This last year has been horrible in terms of stress; between the isolation of always trying to be ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù the loss of my full social life, and the fact that my job isn‚Äôt safe for me right now.   


In my routine bloodwork last month, my wbc were 2.4, which is much lower than my usual. Was tested again on Thursday and they are now 1.9, which triggered a call from my rheumatologist saying that is a ‚Äúcritical level‚Äù and that I need to be extremely careful to not get sick. The plan is to basically live in a bubble for the next three weeks and then test again. If they are still super low, he wants to ‚Äúget more aggressive ‚Äú with my lupus treatment/medication. He said this could be the lupus attacking my blood cells. Other than this news, my body feels physically ok‚Äîno pain or swelling etc‚Äîbut I have had a drastic loss of appetite for the last 8 months.  


Just wondering if anyone else has any experience with suddenly dropping wbc counts and what route your doctor took. I‚Äòm attempting to get a referral to a hematologist bc I would feel better if everything else was ruled out before I go on a more aggressive treatment plan (my mother of course thinks I must have leukemia‚Ä¶).

1 child (12 years old)  
 Overweight and gaining because I can‚Äôt even ride on my bike anymore without extreme pain, I can only walk for about 10 minutes before I have to pull my foot up from pain.

Migraines, rash up when I get too hot or am in the sun to long (lasts 5-6 hours after exposure), mouth ulcers often, swollen feet and hands, index finger is swollen and red and sometimes will have a bump on it that becomes VERY itchy and oozes, raynauds in lips, hands and feet, extreme fatigue (after a semi-busy day I catch myself closing my eyes even while driving), neck pain and swelling, massive foot pain (been limping for a few months now), easy bruising (turning my office chair into my desk can leave a bruise lol..)

ANA 1:320 speckled   
CRP - high   
RF - Neg   
Sed rate - normal range   
HLA-B27 - Neg   
LA - tests range was less than or equal to 40, mine was 40.  The rheum is considering this to be positive.

 CREA - low   
ALKP - high   
Everything else liver and kidney wise is within range

**doctor:**  
 specializes in PsA and due to family history believes it‚Äôs probably PsA. She says that since my rash goes away after a few hours (5-6ish) that it‚Äôs probably not lupus related. She also says the ANA doesn‚Äôt matter much because it‚Äôs like saying I have a car, but not the kind of car. It was always my understanding that PsA normally doesn‚Äôt trigger a pos ANA.

She did keep asking about miscarriages, which I told her I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had. I didn‚Äôt realize this was a question related to clotting because I have incredibly heavy periods with large clots, so I wasn‚Äôt able to tell her this at first visit. If I have had miscarriages, I‚Äôve always believed them to be at the cellular level.

My sister, who has PsA, actually thinks it‚Äôs probably lupus.

I‚Äôm unsure if all of the results have come in, but it looks like the results are a mixed bag. My symptoms lean more towards lupus, but could be either or both. My blood work doesn‚Äôt seem to lean towards anything. All I know is that I‚Äôm exhausted and in pain constantly.

I've been seeing a rheumatologist recently after my annual bloodwork revealed rheumatoid factor.

My next appointment is just a follow-up in January, she said that if my symptoms worsen she might put me on plaquenil but otherwise for now, it's just monitoring the disease.

I've become severely depressed as of late - the stress of having what feels like an axe hanging over my neck and how it'll impact my future, feeling lonely and without a support network, unemployed (due to reasons) and financial stress. I've been feeling extremely lethargic and tired, and crying every single day. Starting two days ago, for some reason my hands are tingling/numb and I have tenderness/pain in one joint, but otherwise there is no swelling or any color changes. I told my doctor that I've been having joint pain in a finger, but she said that if it's lupus-related I would generally have joint pain in multiple places. I'm very worried because my career is highly specialized and requires use of my hands.

I just feel so overwhelmed and depressed, not knowing whether this is lupus-related or  anxiety/depression-related or both, and I'm worrying that all my worrying might make my symptoms worse. Should I just call my doctor and ask for the plaquenil or am I making things worse by stressing out?

I'm new to the community here and thought I'd introduce myself. I'm a 32 year old female with Lupus. Like many of you, I was misdiagnosed for years, and I mean *years*. One doctor visit to the next, blood work, scans, etc, before it was narrowed down to Lupus. 

For a while now my Lupus has been at bay. With occasional flares that last 3-4 days, sure it's painful, but I don't need to tell you all that. Somehow we get through it and continue on with our daily lives.

But I recently just made it through one of my worst flares yet. Completely bedridden for almost 6 days. My knees felt like someone took a sledgehammer to them, eyelashes and fingernails even hurt.

I could barely lift my phone because it hurt my wrists and it took all my energy to text friends or family as the pads of my fingertips hurt to touch the phone's keyboard. So to say the least, it was a brutal one.

But I come here wanting to know if anyone else experiences swollen eyes during a flare? Usually I can tell a flare is coming on if one of my eyes starts to get a little puffy. Then typically a few days after, the flare usually hits, and that eye becomes even more swollen. I'm talking it sometimes looks like I've gotten into a bar fight swollen.

Just curious if anyone else can relate to this because after this last flare, I seriously had moments of doubt. I didn't see the light at the end of the tunnel like I usually do. There were moments of wanting to give up because the pain was so intense. And now I'm really nervous what my next flare holds as I don't know if I can handle such an intense one again.

710,5,"Losartan for lupus nephritis Hi all I'm new here, f25, recently diagnosed with lupus nephritis about 2.5 months ago. Upon discharge from the hospital (I was admitted due to high potassium and swelling) they put me on Cellcept, a Prednisone taper, hydroxychloroquine, bactrim, and dexilant, most of which I gather is standard fare.
They told me to get a nephrologist (the hospital was out of state) and 3wks ago she added losartan 25mg to the mix. Upon asking why she said it was for the side effects to keep the kidney function from decreasing further, despite saying previously that my kidney had already gotten back to 90% function and was improving based on blood work trends.
I know googling is often bad but I see results saying it's a high blood pressure medication and contains potassium. My baseline bp was already low (108/60) and now it's hovering around 95/65. My resting hr was around 67 before taking it and is now at 72. I was an avid runner and crossfitter before this and now I'm worried that being on this long term will keep me from getting back to intense exercise eventually.

714,7,"Alternatives to hydroxychloroquine? I was recently diagnosed with SLE and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. I started on hydroxychloroquine a little over a week ago. I had no notable side effects until yesterday when I got a rash on both forearms. It's definitely not Steven's Johnson's rash. It's mild and doesn't itch or hurt. It seemed to go down a bit when I took Benadryl.

My current rheum had said if I got a rash I had to stop taking it. But I've read that when the rash is a mild (and common!) allergic reaction, many doctors have you stop and the start again at a lower dose to see if you can tolerate it. Given that I've read that this is the drug that may save me from having severe complications due to Lupus (e.g., I currently have no kidney or liver involvement) and is pretty much a miracle drug for us, I am absolutely not going ot give up easily.  

But in the event that I have to ... what is the alternative to hydroxychloroquine? I know there are other antimalarials, but it's clear to me that this one is supposed to be the best. I think many people allergic to hydroxychloroquine are also allergic to chloroquine. 

For those of you who had an allergic reaction to hydroxychloroquine and had to stop taking it, what do you take instead? Have any of you had a reaction, stopped, then restarted at a lower dose?

It left me speechless, sleepless, hopeless, and frightened. Every breath I took felt like I was being stabbed by a serial killer. 


Anyways‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt have another flare up until I was 20. And boy oh boy it was a fucking FLARE UP. At first it started with a horrendous chest infection which went away after a week or so. Then I got a double ear infection which led to pneumonia? Yeah.. I know. Autoimmune disorders are fun!!! After that I was diagnosed with mono which left me jobless and bed ridden for weeks.

I have lupus and some other autoimmune junk going on. Lately we've got everything all sorted out and I feel so much better, like I haven't felt this good in years. I finally have the energy to do things, like go to a powerlifting gym and do strongman stuff.

But I still have bad days, and flare ups, and weird little moments where I'm fighting something stupid my body is doing and I just can't explain it to people who don't have quite as unpredictable bodies.

And my boss at work and my coaches at the gym a lot of times just want to be encouraging and get me pepped up. I know I do struggle sometimes with confidence. I'm not used to being able to do things.

737,62,"Anyone else go through years of symptoms in their teens where everyone they reached out to about them brushed it off as being lazy/overdramatic? I'm going to start this off by saying I've(26f) never been the type of person to want others pitying me or worrying about me, so when my symptoms first started I ignored them. I brushed it off, myself, as stress and nothing more. My hair started falling out (though it's always been thick so even losing handfuls throughout the days would go unnoticed by everyone but me), my joints had already been hurting consistently since middle school, and I was finding it harder and harder to stay awake. I was struggling to do basic things like my chores. I begged my dad to take me to get it checked out, he said it was probably nothing and to just start going to bed earlier (I was already sleeping 9-10 hours a night). I talked to teachers and the school nurses and they all thought it was growth spurts or me trying to get out of class. Years of various adults would always ignore and dismiss my pleas because ""there's no way a child your age is actually hurting like you claim, so stop faking, so being lazy and grow up. Just do your chores and stop complaining"" (I was about 12 when this was said to me, and it stuck with me because it was said by my own father, so naturally it devastated me)
Once I was old enough to drive myself (and thankfully had a doctor I could go to any time without paying through my father's job at the time) I went to them. They theorized mild arthritis, depression and anxiety (which, duh! I'd been told my whole life that I was overreacting when I had been in constant pain the whole time). I then spoke with my cousin (who is an RN with a step daughter with lupus that also went undiagnosed for so long she went into renal failure before they realized and ended up on chemotherapy for a while but has since recovered and lives a happy full life) about my symptoms. I had spoken to her before but she didn't have the experience with it yet and didn't make the connections back then. She sat with me and finally listened in depth to everything I've gone through and experienced. She suggested I request an ANA test be done. No theories, just that I need to request that specific test. I did and it came back negative so the autoimmune disorder continued to go undiagnosed. I kept up my complaints and research. I kept talking to my cousin as well about it because I finally had someone who listened and understood something really was wrong. Every time my doctor's office would switch professionals(they rotated, as it was technically an on site clinic for the employees and their families at my father's job) I would request that ANA again. It came back negative so many times but I just knew I had to keep asking. I know autoimmune disorders can present even with a negative ANA) I started having neurological symptoms. I'd zone out, lose time, and my anxiety and depression deepened. I felt like I was losing my mind. I brought the loss of time to my newest provider (same office, she was just a newer hire and to this day I believe she is the most professional and most amazing doctor I've ever had) and with that added to my other symptoms and the consistent ANA tests, she decided to try again. This time my ANA was positive and I showed positive for Lyme disease (which, as us lupus warriors know, lupus often causes false positives for Lyme disease). She put me through the mandatory treatment for Lyme disease, just in case, and referred me to a rheumatologist who confirmed I have lupus. A month after my diagnosis (bless that sweet doctor and my new rheumatologist) I found out that the time loss and zoning out was absence seizures, as I ended up in the ER after having a seizure while driving to work. We still haven't figured out if the seizures are actually connected, but I've also been officially diagnosed with epilepsy as well. Needless to say, my father and every adult I maintained contact with that always brushed me off suddenly felt very ashamed for it. 
I guess my point is... if you think you have lupus, no matter how many people doubt you, keep fighting to get the right diagnosis. I've been diagnosed and treated for a year now and, while I still get flare ups during especially stressful times, the hydroxychloroquine helps. It helps so much, my pain levels are minimal and I feel more human than I have in the 16 years it took to get diagnosed. There's hope, always.",General,1

741,8,"Flares & Scares 20yr F - Currently Working Part-time and School Full-time

Hi! So this is like my third time posting in the last few months, but life is not getting any better for me at the moment. I have had two flares within the past four months, but the down time in between was nothing amazing as I was tapering of Prednisone.

New symptoms have arisen that include:

* chest pain
* hair loss (resulting in a bald spot on my temple)
* shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing
* dry eyes and mouth
* serious stomach issues that impact daily life

This is all in addition to my symptoms that started in May of 2021. Those symptoms include:

* migraines
* vision changes
* increased fatigue
* increased anxiety
* light sensitivity
* joint pain
* appetite changes

Not to mention so many others that I can never remember because of the brain fog.

Last night the chest pain got so bad that I went to the ER after days of debating with my mom & bf. I was diagnosed with pleurisy, and was given multiple tests/scans due to a concern of blood clots in my lungs (still a possibility). They noted tachycardia in my chart, as well as myocarditis, both things that need to be taken seriously in lupus patients. I was given a CT, X-ray, and a three day dose of 40mg Prednisone.

I was waiting to get into my rheum until October, but I called this morning and they are finally getting me in on Tuesday (sept. 7th)! I am so excited, but still incredibly anxious as I am worried I won't be taken seriously as that has already been happening quite a bit with my doctors.

I have had neuropathy and pain in my legs for years. I was diagnosed with a severe B-12 deficiency. I also have gastric issues that they have never been able to explain. Each time we would test and test and eventually the pain would get better‚Ä¶for a while. I have redness in my cheeks that gets worse sometimes. 

Last week I got a migraine Tuesday night. Wednesday I woke up extremely weak. I took my blood sugar level (I‚Äôm not diabetic but have had common diabetic symptoms for years). My bgl was 71. I ate and drank juice and peanut butter. I kept testing it and could never get it above 75. I felt like my arms and legs were stuck in sand when I walked. I had to lean against trees when taking my dogs outside. My fingers started swelling. 

Thursday I went to my PCP. My bgl was 51. My blood pressure was super high and I had an abnormal ekg. I couldn‚Äôt talk, my brain was extremely foggy, and I was just spacey. I lost all feeling in my hands and feet. They turned blue and stone cold. She sent me to the ER. They did four tests (counting a pregnancy test) then told me they didn‚Äôt see anything life threatening and sent me home. I was miserable all weekend. I started having abdominal pain, pain in my shoulder blades, up my spine, and severe dizziness. 

Monday I had a CT scan. It showed enteritis. My doctor sent me to the ER. I spent 12 hours there for the doctor to tell me he didn‚Äôt see anything wrong.

Been getting progressively sicker for 4 years and just got diagnosed with lupus about 4 months ago.

I think I'm having one currently.   It comes on the heels of 2 weeks of extreme heat and very intense family/personal stress.  Red rash on my neck returned, some mouth sores, headaches daily and everyday at least 2-4 body parts don't work due to joint pain and muscle inflammation.
When you get these flares I wonder, how do you know it's just a ""breakthrough flare up"" or if your meds just aren't working?   
I've been feeling this way for at least 2 weeks.

Hi guys, I'm a 24yr old female and I was diagnosed with SLE and APS at 12, have had severe vasculitis, blood clots, progressive autoimmune hearing loss+tinnitus, secondary SVT, and overall have had a pretty shitty time with managing my illness up until about a year ago when my bloodwork started showing improvements. I just got some more labs done this last week, and most of it was so normal that you wouldn't know I had a chronic illness just looking at the results. The only things out of whack were a slightly low C4 and some vitamin markers, but my ANA and dsDNA titers were way out of normal range, so I definitely still have lupus. Additionally, I still feel like absolute dog shite most of the time. My joints always hurt, I can never get on a consistent exercise regimen bc it agitates one body part or another so badly I can't use it for 3 days minimum, my reynaud's is the worst it's ever been, I have constant headaches, dizziness, loss of sensation, ocular migraines, sleeping problems, fatigue and it seems like the list goes on. My doctor almost seemed disbelieving about my complaints when we went over the results. I guess my question in general is if anyone experiences something like this?

There's no swelling or stiffness. The imaging clearly shows that the plica is inflamed and thickened. When it's really inflamed, it gets pinched when I bend my knee and causes a knife sharp pain. The pain had never gone away entirely since this began over a year ago, but it varies considerably. When it's bad, it hurts to walk and I need to go down stairs backwards, one step at a time. When it's relatively okay, it's tolerable and I can do a lot of stuff. Jogging and lunging is always out of the question, though.

It seems to be from systemic inflammation (other causes ruled out, it's not an overuse injury and no amount of rest or PT has made a difference, and it started suddenly in both knees simultaneously) so I accept it's a symptom of my Lupus.

But trying to make a very long story short I feel like she's done fuck all apart from prescribing HCQ in the time I've been seeing her.  Her usual response to everything is ""Yeaaaah that's just what this is like.  Come back in three months.""

She's given me no suggestions for dealing with the pain.  She didn't warn me that allergic reactions would trigger lupus flareups in spite of a ridiculously long allergy list in my chart.  She told me I couldn't do anything about the rash on my feet which itches like I stepped in an ant's nest - my primary care doctor was seeing me for something unrelated and said ""Wow that's bad! Let me prescribe you something for it.""  It cleared up in a few days and I'd had it for two months.

Don't you have prednisone?""  Fucking what???  No...my rheumatologist never mentioned this, why is my gynecologist telling me about it??  I complained about the pain yet again and the rheumatologist told me I should just be thankful I only have joint issues and no organ involvement.  Which...yes I'm VERY thankful I know lots of folks have it a lot worse but that's not helping.  And finally she ran more blood tests which were much worse than the last ones and when I asked her what it meant she got kind of snappish and said ""It doesn't mean anything!""

I was seeing my primary for a follow-up last week and I wound up ranting about it to him because I feel like this is completely taking over my life.

I want to thank everyone who has contributed because I have found this sub comforting and helpful throughout my medical process. I am unsure what to do and wanted to seek advice and possible guidance? 

\*\*\*Mods, I am not sure if this is the right thread or not.

I have been dismissed constantly by many doctors and specialists. I don't normally post, so I wanted honest feedback/advice. I'm going to try my best to quickly list what has happened to give you an idea of what they have found so far:

  
\- I had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, HIDA scan, MRI, and two ultrasounds done within the past few months. I have also had a lot, and I mean A LOT of bloodwork done, so my arms are still bruised and swollen because of how often I am being pricked.   
\- Results for colonoscopy came back basically normal. Endoscopy showed that erosion in the duodenum had esophageal stenosis (benign), and flattened mucosa was found. I do not have celiac, and from my colonoscopy, I don't have Crohn's or anything else related. However, I have continued to have extreme bloating and pain.   
\- HIDA scan showed that I have a hyperkinetic gallbladder, so my gallbladder doesn't work. They are not considering surgery now because I am still dealing with basic G.I. issues that I am currently trying to treat. However, they are requesting another endoscopy to make sure the medication is working.  
\- Blood work for b12 came back abnormal, and I was deficient. My ferritin levels and monocytes were also low. I also have a high WBC, and there isn't a clear cause. They tested my CRP (14.6) and ESR (21), and both were elevated. Additionally, I have high cholesterol now (not needing medication), am insulin resistant (discovered I have PCOS), and slightly elevated testosterone levels.   
\- I did have cysts on my ovaries (the PCOS diagnosis) and a benign tumor in the uterus wall.   
\- Rash on my scalp and I have a lesion on my arm, as well as confirmed hair loss (unknown cause)  
\- Eye rash that my PCP claims could also be autoimmune-related  
\- Sinus tachycardia also awaiting further workup for heart palpitations

  
However, this doesn't explain many other symptoms I am still experiencing, and many doctors suggested I see a Rheumatologist. These symptoms are:

\- My vision seems to be impacted. Sometimes my eyes move rapidly (involuntarily) while I am just minding my own business. Sometimes have pain behind the eyes.  
\- I had headaches every day for two weeks straight and, in general, have had a lot of headaches.  
\- Sometimes my hands shake too much that I can't grip things and drop them often.   
\- I also get rashes that burn on my hands and feet that look almost blotchy.  
\- Hands, wrists, fingers, and ankles swell and sometimes are stiff. They also hurt, and I can't usually even hold my phone. Unfortunately, this has been happening more often.    
\- I urinate a lot at night, sometimes have burning, but not often. Sometimes it looks super dark or foamy despite how much water I drink ( I mainly only drink water).   
\- Body aches and pains all over. One in particular that gets bad is my left side to the point that I can't even walk, sit, or even lie down. It becomes so painful and stiff.   
\- Feeling dizzy when walking or standing, feeling like I am being ""pushed down"" from the top of the head. Idk how to describe it, but it doesn't feel normal.   
\- My lymph nodes get so swollen/they hurt that I can't lift my arms sometimes, specifically in the armpit and groin areas.   
\- Stuttering that has never occurred ever in my life and constant brain fog. I can't think or formulate anything.   
\- constant fatigue and lower back pain or neck pain  
\- mouth sores that appear on my tongue or in my mouth  
\- Night sweats

777,0,"Looking for advice from those suffering autoimmune (or who are very familiar with them) Just wanted to ask for general advice from those either suffering from lupus/autoimmune issues or perhaps have a much better knowledge of it than I. Apologies in advance for this will certainly be lengthy as I want to try and get as much information that may be relevant included. 

I‚Äôve generally had some of these symptoms for several years, mostly manifesting in my later teen years. However, I have noticed a drastic increase and addition of symptoms as a result of appendicitis and peritonitis that occurred in late 2019 whilst I was abroad. Following a return to the UK I went through a four month period of severe night sweats, chronic pain in joints, muscles and chest, sudden weight loss, fatigue and what I perceived to be flushing on the central portion of my face/nose. Thankfully, I was able to improve health wise but do not feel since the incident I have fully recovered. One of my main concerns has been lupus or autoimmune-related issues, which were only brought to my attention due to the ‚Äòflushing‚Äô on my face. My other symptoms which have caused concern include;

\- Mouth ulcers. I have always been someone afflicted with ulcers, particularly when unwell. However, they‚Äôre far more common now and often find themselves in areas where no teeth-related trauma could have caused them (under the tongue, back of the throat, the outside of my lips,  roof of mouth etc.)

\- Joint and bone pain, strangely more so on the left side of my body in fingers, knee, hip etc.

\- Kidney infection ‚Äì twice in the left kidney last year which was thankfully mild and did improve after a long course of antibiotics and painkillers. 

\- Stomach issues, which are by no means new to me. However, this year I‚Äôve now become accustomed to having acid reflux and globus sensation, something that I hadn‚Äôt experienced prior to January 2021.

\- Migraines, which my doctor has also referred to as ‚Äòcluster headaches‚Äô due to the pattern they follow. Typically deal with by laying in a quiet darkened room, with tiger balm being the only thing that offers any sort of relief. I do have two benign brain tumours, which were ultimately diagnosed as a result of my GP doing an MRI to look into the headaches. I‚Äôve been assured that the headaches are not to do with the tumours, which my GP/endocrinologist are in agreement would be too small to cause any significant pain (I tend to agree with them). 

\- Sudden onset fever/feeling of malaise or flu-like symptoms. This is harder to explain, but randomly some days (typically late afternoon) I‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôve developed a cold or flu, and will follow the process of drinking lots of fluids, taking paracetamol or whatever OTC remedy I have‚Ä¶ and then bizarrely by the time I wake up the next day all symptoms have vanished. These weird flares off ‚Äòtemporary‚Äô illness typically cause me to flush badly, severe migraine, high temperature, blocked nose/sore throat and swollen glands. I cannot notice an obvious pattern of what causes these, but it‚Äôs typical I get them after a day involving a lot of activity/travel (particularly prevalent when going to and from work). 

\- Central erythema which I initially believed was rosacea. Neither parent in my family has rosacea, but I had assumed rosacea based off it fitting the description for Subtype 1 (telangiectasia, symmetrical redness which initially came and went but has over time become more permanent due to strained blood vessels). The area itself feels warm, and I do my best to keep it out of sunlight/avoid stereotypical rosacea triggers. 

A follow up with my doctor several months ago led to them asking to see a picture of the rash, which worried him as he felt it fit (in his mind) the appearance of a ‚Äòbutterfly rash‚Äô. This combined with several family members having autoimmune issues (celiac disease, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis) enabled him to send me for several blood tests. The doctor had told me that one test (celiac) came back negative, which was of no surprise to me as I‚Äôve never noticed an issue with gluten. He also had put me down for an ANA, which I never received the results for but am of the belief it was negative. I am uncertain as I had to call the surgery weeks after to request the result, only to find out the doctor in question had move practices, but I was informed by the secretary that as far as she could see on my notes ‚Äúall normal‚Äù. Months later though I still find myself afflicted by the above symptoms, and it is really beginning to take a mental toll on top of the already strained physical pain such symptoms provide. I am due to start a new career at the end of September and really want to get a jump on any medical follow ups I should be looking into, and primarily I cannot shake the autoimmune/lupus angle despite the supposed negative ANA. I do know that many individuals with autoimmune issues (a family member included) go undiagnosed for years, and whilst I‚Äôd like to say I‚Äôm free of any such condition, I also want to ensure I am doing right by my own health if that includes not being satisfied by my current situation and what I feel at times is a lack of interest from my local general practitioner/s. 

My main questions would be

Would I be wrong to completely accept autoimmune issues (lupus in particular) are highly-unlikely if this first ANA as far as I‚Äôm aware has come back negative? Are my symptoms even remotely similar to what anyone here faces? Or perhaps hallmarks for other conditions/illnesses that I‚Äôm unaware of? I feel the more I know or am prepared with would certainly make the managing of this strange health-episode easier. Many thanks to all in advance!",Advice,0

779,11,"Recently diagnosed, question about photosensitivity Hi everyone. I was just diagnosed with SLE (and secondary APS). I have never experienced any sun sensitivity thus far. In fact, I've always tolerated sunlight relatively well. I always wear sunscreen and a hat to protect my face (I'm prone to hyperpigmentation on my face only), but regularly walk in 90 degree heat in tanks and shorts. I LOVE the sun and the heat and tolerate it very well. I hydrate, but I never find it to be too much. I do try to always wear full body sunscreen and after this diagnosis, will be religious about this.

**So, here's my question**: Is it possible that the sun is causing flares and damage even if I don't experience sun sensitivity or rashes after being in the sun? That is, might I be harming myself by spending time in the sun without realizing it? I know that I may suddenly become sun sensitive when I wasn't before ... I think I'm in the early stages of SLE. (Just started hydroxychloroquine and hoping this will help to prevent things from getting worse.)

**Here's another way to put the question**: I know that not everyone with SLE is photosensitive. But are the UV rays especially bad for all people with SLE, including those who do not have any obvious adverse reaction?

I'll be super religious about sun protection all over my body regardless, but basically I want to know if it's foolish to walk in the heat in tanks and shorts even with good sunscreen covering my body. I live in Alabama, so it's pretty hot here.

I should say, the reason I'm reluctant to cut back on my ""outside time"" is because, like many others, I find that being outside in the light--especially walking or exercising in the light--really helps with depression an anxiety. I work near windows whenever possible to try to keep my mood up. I'm having a bit of trouble dealing with the SLE and APS diagnoses and don't want to make things harder on myself by avoiding sunlight unnecessarily. I'm hoping that good sunscreen and maybe some new protective clothing will be sufficient.

Nothing too serious, but couldn't breathe properly for the next three months, then hospitalized for 10 days with normal blood tests but severe joint pain, hot waves and sweatness from nowhere, extreme fatigue and of course my heart problems plus the fact that my heart was REALLY aching, like I thought I was going to pass out‚Äîto be clear, I started with those symptoms before those horrible three months. Left the hospital without a diagnose, but a month later at my doctor's appointment she says ""it may be lupus but I need a more time. Give me some months"".

781,6,"ANA Results Question - Recently Diagnosed I am recently diagnosed with lupus, and have a questioned about ANA Results.

I have chronic kidney disease and back in January my new nephrologist wanted to see if she could figure out the underlying cause of my disease. She ran a bunch of labs and everything came back normal and I didn't think much of it. Fast forward to this month and I was diagnosed with lupus and my rheumatologist said that lupus could be the cause of my CKD. 

I didn't think to ask him at the time, but on a whim went and looked at the labs my nephrologist did in January and she had checked ANA and it was negative. The first panel done my by rheumatologist showed 1:160 (speckled) in June and the second panel (Avise CTD) showed a titer of 1:320 (homogenous) in July. Obviously I can ask him when I see him again next month at my follow up, but I am really curious if it's ""normal"" to have a negative ANA and then 6 months later be positive? 

He said he would request the records from my nephrologist so he would have them for my next visit, so I am sure he will see this as well.

I have been having symptoms off and on for about 9 years so it just seems odd that I would have had a negative ANA in January if I have lupus. 

I guess I am just questioning if I have the right diagnosis, and if this has ever happened to anyone else. 

My Avise CTD showed positive (tier 2) for lupus, and that coupled with other labs and symptoms led my rheumatologist to diagnose me with lupus. I did have a large number of visits (with him, my GP, and a few other specialists along the way) leading to my diagnosis. At my first visit the rheumatologist said that I might have fibromyalgia, as I don't have any rashes so he wasn't initially thinking it was actually lupus.

In conclusion, clinical and ultrasound-proved enthesitis are frequent in SLE patients. Quadriceps tendon insertion is the most affected enthesis. Clinical enthesitis tends to occur in older SLE patients. GUESS score notably correlated with; age,¬†BMI, and SLEDAI-2K score. BMI and SLEDAI-2K are predictors for increased GUESS score.

In the beginning of this summer I had multiple skin biopsies and they showed lupus.

She thought I have systemic lupus probably and not only skin lupus. 

But the rheumatologist (it was not the first I had seen since 2008) was very rude and dismissive. My blood work showed: low albumin, slightly anemic but normal b12, folic acid and iron and ferritin. Low leukocytes, low positive ANA, sjogren antibodies were not tested with the new test they had. I had high sed rate and normal CRP. The teardrop eye test (schirmer test) was positive. I had 1mm in both eyes, normal range is 10+mm. 

The IGM test was almost too low. Under 0.40 is too low and I had 0.40. 

My urine had leukocytes in it and red blood cells. No bacteria found. 

My blood pressure was high, 150/90. Though normally it was always low and they didn‚Äôt check again to confirm the high blood pressure.  

I have swollen ankles and fingers. And raynaud‚Äôs, also in summer when temperatures change suddenly from hot to ‚Äòcold‚Äô. 

But all these things were fine, said the rheumatologist. He diagnosed me with fibromyalgia. Here in my country in Europe they don‚Äôt treat fibromyalgia.. 

About the mouth ulcers he said: ‚Äúyou only get those on the roof of your mouth, so it‚Äôs not auto immune. Then you would get them on your lips. And it‚Äôs abnormal you only get them on the same place every time.‚Äù

About the malar rash he said: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs sunburn and looks like a malar rash because your wear sunglasses‚Äù

The dryness didn‚Äôt get addressed either. It‚Äôs from my birth control pill he said. He didn‚Äôt listen to me telling him I‚Äôm only on birth control since two years and the dryness started way before that. 

He also said I look way too healthy to be sick. ‚ÄúYou have a perfect figure and weight, you have a nice tan, it‚Äôs not sle, enjoy your healthy body‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt know what to do now. My GP doesn‚Äôt want to refer me to another rheumatologist, she says I‚Äôm fine and she‚Äôs okay with it if I want to talk about it with a psychiatrist. And that I just need to continue applying the creams I got for my skin and avoid the sun. 
She said I‚Äôm way to self conscious about my health and I already saw enough specialists since 2008. You never got a diagnosis besides fibromyalgia, so there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you.

800,6,"Wondering‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been diagnosed with SLE since 2019. Somehow they caught it as it started to develop, I was very, very lucky. Things have been relatively mild as a result with me mostly staying on plaquenil. I did try methotrexate shots with significant increases between October and February. However, it made me too sick and I ended up in the ER a lot. Tried a few other meds, same effect. Finally, now in 2021 towards the end I‚Äôm on cellcept. Only mildly sick. 
ANYWAY I‚Äôm concerned about something that may involve SLE and kidneys. I‚Äôve been pretty sick for quite some time and the past two? Three? Months I‚Äôve had three-four kidney related urinary tract infections. I‚Äôve never had any problems with my kidneys show up in the bloodwork in the past. Granted it‚Äôs been like half a year or something, but still. Also I‚Äôve had pretty significant stomach problems that we are concerned is gastroparesis. Like we had diagnosis down, but now I‚Äôm wondering..,could it actually be a lupus/kidney issue? 
Has anyone had declining kidney issues begin this way? I‚Äôm concerned.",Advice,0
801,13,"how do i find a reason to keep going? sometimes i feel like we get so focused on taking care of ourselves physically and we do all these treatments and therapies and remedies but forget to take care of our minds.
tonight i was in the car with my mom and she was asking me questions about what it‚Äôs like to live with lupus. it got me to thinking about how incredibly strong we all are, constant unrelenting pain and discomfort and yet we stay sane. she was telling me she had a painful hip for a few days and was realizing that the discomfort and desperation to get rid of the pain must be how i feel constantly, and she was saying she feels proud of me.
but sometimes i don‚Äôt feel strong, or beautiful, or like a warrior. i can understand how somebody would end their life over this. it‚Äôs miserable and when i start thinking about how it‚Äôll never go away, i get filled with this deep sensation of despair. i wonder if it‚Äôs worth it? i never have time to do anything fun, i just work and then go home and sleep because i‚Äôm too tired for anything else. i don‚Äôt put effort into my appearance and i just feel like i‚Äôm awful to look at. the kind words of sympathies don‚Äôt make me feel better. i feel like a burden to people. i should be on my way to moving out or college or something greater than this. but i watch my friends go out and have fun and i just get so‚Ä¶ sad? but it‚Äôs not even sadness anymore. i just feel exhausted. i want my life to be normal. but it never will be. and i‚Äôll never do the things my friends can do. it just doesn‚Äôt feel like its worth it anymore. i‚Äôve been trying to find a reason that putting up with this pain would be worth it but i just can‚Äôt find one. why would i keep doing this to myself? years of mental and physical pain for no point? just to die anyways? i don‚Äôt want to die but the alternative is looking worse to me. i get no reward from living. i work just to spend the money on stuff to make working even possible with the pain i endure. i don‚Äôt buy nice things because whats the point if i don‚Äôt even have time for them? it‚Äôs miserable to be alive.",Venting,1
802,6,"A title in which Today was a very bad day. The last three or four days i have been anticipating a major flare (i get particularly bad and painfuk SLE flares) and i knew it was coming but then ive never had one induced by stress before. I was informed my uncle had died from covid complications and im losing it... Its hard enough dealing with one or the other but together idk... My rash emerged in spades and symptoms were just phenominally worse. I dont think i can handle this kind of pain again, after 15 years of ""handling"" this i think its finally getting over on me.

The stress is unreal. And i mean un-friggin-real",Venting,0
