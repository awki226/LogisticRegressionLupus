1,5,"Morning breathing issues Lupus Nephritis stage 5 here. Every morning recently I wake up feeling very out of breath, like everything is super tight to breathe. I can get oxygen, it's just harder to take in. Movement makes it worse, sitting, makes it somewhat better. I tend to have a lot of fluid, mucus, etc that I cough up. I know I have had fluid in and around my lungs the last few months in scans. The breathing and excess mucus/fluid mostly goes away as I take my meds. Some times, if I have this issue during the day, the docs have had me take a Lasix to remove the fluid floating around. I just can't take Lasix daily because it then messes around with my bp meds and kidney function. Does anyone else get this hard to breathe feeling, especially in the am?? Brought it up in my last nephrology appointment and provider felt it was the opposite reaction from my meds I should be having after I take them.

5,8,"Lupus? Mystery autoimmune disorder? Advice? 18F I guess I'm mostly posting here as a last resort. I'll start from the beginning. I know reddit isn't a doctors office but i'm feeling hopeless in achieving any type of diagnosis and lupus seems like the most likely one at this point. 

Last January (17 at the time) I was hospitalized from drug induced ITP. What caused the ITP was Bactrim, was taking it for a normal UTI. My platelet count went all the way down to 0. I was tested for various different things since they didn't know what was wrong with me at first, and my ANA was positive & speckled. However, everything else was normal. I was treated with two IVIG treatments and discharged two weeks later. After this my health problems were exacerbated, I started having extreme edema and pitting in my legs to the point that it was painful to walk and it was made worse by physical activity and as I work at starbucks and am a full time student at a big university, there was a lot of walking. I also noticed I started to get these flare ups. I would get them pre-hospitalization, but they were mostly psychogenic fevers caused by stress with no other symptoms besides exhaustion. However after hospitalization they were accompanied with a burning butterfly rash, fatigue, frequently a headache and all over pain, I call it ""exhaustion pain"" I don't really have a better word for it. It happens randomly but seems to happen more when im stressed, happens at LEAST once a month but with finals season it's happening every week and lasts anywhere between a few hours-multiple days. I haven't mentioned this to my rheumatologist yet because I actually thought it was normal since my mother has the same types of flare ups but she is diagnosed with a handful of autoimmune disorders, i don't believe she is diagnosed with lupus though but it does run in my family. Lupus seems like the ""best bet"" diagnosis wise as my doctors are all sure i do have an autoimmune disease but it's a more of a waiting game to find out which it is as my blood hasn't hit most of the ""markers"". 
Lab results from January 2020:
- ANA positive & speckled 
- dsDNA negative
- antismith negative
- thyroid panel normal range
- c3 & c4 normal range

however I did get my c3 checked again in june and it was high but my doctor didn't mention anything, just ignored it and i can't remember if i had any flare up symptoms at that time.

other weird symptoms:
- scalp lesions & scabs
- hard time regulating temperature 
- extreme hand swelling to the point where it hurts and it's hard to move my hands, not caused by allergies just random. Rheumatologist said it wasn't reynauds and gave me a referral to an allergist who's also an immunologist but i won't see them till january, ive really never seen anything like it so im also wondering if anyone else experiences the same thing. Ill insert links to pictures of the swelling compared to my normal hand size.

I even had my rheumatologist provide with them a document confirming my condition.

14,23,"medicinal mushrooms for lupus Hi all,

Like many of us with lupus, I've been struggling to find the right medication regimen for me that balances symptom reduction against side effects. For me at least, I've been frustrated with immunosuppressants because they seem just make me weaker and less able to do things I love. It's unclear if it is just my lupus getting worse or if it's the drugs, but my goal is to get off of them to better answer that question. But what is stopping me at the moment is pain. Immunosuppressants do not get rid of it, but they seem to reduce it.  

Anyway, in my quest to manage pain and feel better, I've done a bunch of research on medicinal mushrooms. Im currently trying turkey tail at 2-3g per day (trying 3 now) for inflammation and pain and lions mane for brain fog. It's too early to tell if lions mane is working as it hasn't been 2-3 weeks. 

I've noticed some promising results with turkey tail and plan to add in reishi and cordyceps. All 3 have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects like dmards. Turkey tail is the most studied, it seems, for it's anti-cancer and tumor shrinking abilities. 

For me, my body seems more resilient to stress and more energy which is exciting. I still have lupus if course but I'm able to do more so I feel closer to how I felt when I was just on plaquenil and my lupus was more mild. I have noticed some pain relieving effects as well, but I do still have pain. 

Of course, with any alternative treatment, Western research and guidance is scarce. So I wanted to see what this community has experienced. Have they worked for you? For what symptoms? What doses? Thanks!",Advice,1

17,6,"Cutaneous Lupus, DILE, or SLE? So, I have some serious redness in my face and on my neck that is pretty much always there. I’ve been on Doxycycline 200mg daily for around 2.5-3 years as well, and about 2 years ago, I went to an Endocrinologist for what I thought was Gynecomastia (man boobs, basically). He gave me a scrip for Tamoxifen/Nolvadex (estrogen inhibitor) and I took it for about three months and for whatever reason just phased out from taking it, either I started to forget it or whatever. After about a month or two, my neck started getting a little red, then slowly and exponentially followed by my face getting more and more red. It’s to the point now that I look like I’m flushed/pink as my baseline always.

I’ve started to spray tan to help mute the color difference since I’m a redhead and have SUPER pale skin + the redness, it seemed like it would and does help. Anyway, that was all towards late 2019 and then throughout 2020 it’s gotten worse and 2021 it’s actually noticeable / people comment “are you burnt??” Etc which is really a self esteem blow sometimes. I have a family history of lupus in both sets of grandparents as well as I have Raynauds, fatigue, memory fog, and headaches. I feel like I make a stronger case for it to be lupus than not, but it makes sense to me for it to be DILE. All of my other medical issues are all inflammatory related as well (costochondritis and prostatitis). 

My primary doc though said he thinks it might be cushings syndrome so I’m being tested for my cortisol level and my dermatologist doesn’t think it’s rosacea anymore since no treatment has worked at all, so I’m not sure what to think.

This week people came into the office that were sick and said many other people from their Thanksgiving gatherings are sick too. When they were told by coworkers they need to go home they refused. While he works remotely the majority of the time he does have to be in close proximity with people who do work from the office in the next few weeks, people don't wear masks and the people that are sick are refusing to test. He's vaccinated, masks all the time, good with hand hygiene and I also got his booster scheduled before his trip but I just have this pit in my gut.

My mom has lupus and had a lot of difficulties in her 20s so I wanted to start going to the doctor early so they could track my symptoms and blood work as soon as symptoms started to worsen. 

Four months ago, I started having the worst flare-up I’ve ever encountered. Almost every day since then, I have constant body aches, extreme fatigue, swollen joints, and overly sensitive skin. I’m posting because almost none of my blood work has been coming back abnormal enough for my rheumatologist to be concerned. I have a positive ANA and my symptoms are consistent with mixed connective tissue disease, SLE, and RA, but my blood work isn’t pointing to any of these diagnoses consistently, and because of my age my doctor is also hesitant to officially diagnose me with one or multiple of these in case it changes.

At my last rheumatologist appointment, because my pain and fatigue has been so bad for this long, my doctor recommended an immunosuppressant, an antidepressant that has been widely prescribed to help with autoimmune pain, and a huge diet overhaul. She told me to consider trying either of the med options, and to adjust my diet ASAP. 

For anyone that may be in a similar boat to me, how do you validate yourself when it feels like you aren’t getting concrete evidence of your pain, and what were the first steps you took?

42,4,"At a loss, suspecting Lupus but asking for suggestions please Prefacing this with it will be a pretty long post. Sorry. I hope this is allowed.

I am 25 years old, female. I am autistic and have severe anxiety and a history of depression.  I've been in chronic joint pain for as long as I can remember. I started complaining about hip pain  when I was 4 years old.  Later diagnosed with scoliosis at 15, this has been the extent of explanation for that, and all of my other pain.I had a bunch of bloodwork done in early 2018, that I never got to see the results for. I have been struggling with a lot of fatigue, tachycardia, joint pain (and more but I'll describe symptoms shortly), which amped up in severity in 2016.I was told all tests normal, dr. started treating me with Cymbalta for Fibromyalgia. However, when I went back due to the medication not working and severely upsetting my stomach, I asked for a copy of my diagnosis due to my being on disability and wanting it for the government. The Dr. then told me it was not formally diagnosed as he's not a specialist - even though I was being treated for it. Treatment ceased, and I gave up.

I recently began trying again to figure what is going on. I had given up, felt crazy and that I must just be making it up in my head and tried to ignore it.A breakdown of what's been going on:I've been photosensitive my entire life. I did not know what was appearing looks like a malar rash until recently. It mostly appears when I'm exposed to sun, or very hot or very cold temperatures.Also if I'm feeling unwell. Which is frequently. I realize this may be Rosacea. I have photos of it from various ages and times in my life.I'm extremely tired all of the time. I never feel well rested no matter how much or how little sleep I get. I feel very worn down all of the time.I get random hives and rashes, mostly on my feet or my thighs other than what appears on my face. Sometimes itchy but often appear out of no where and painless and look like either red dots or purpura.Joint pain in the hips, knees, shoulders, elbows, ankles, wrists and sometimes knuckles.The pain can range from a intense burning sensation, sharp stabbing sensation to a dull ache.Sometimes I get what feels like the growing pain that I got as a kid, in my lower legs (the bone between the knee and the ankle) and it radiates, hurts a lot.Joints hot to the touch when they hurt sometimes.I had thick hair as a kid, stylists told me it was very thick. It started thinning out a lot 4 or 5 years ago and has never been the same since. I don't seem to lose it alarmingly anymore but I do lose more brushing it than I ever did before.I get headaches AT LEAST once a week.I'm clumsy all of the time, I struggle to open heavy public place doors, I feel like I'm just a messy person and constantly dropping items, juggling things around and having poor coordination and running into things.  
fingers and toes get very cold easily and hard to warm up - not to the extent of Reynaud's, as I have a friend who has it and know how white they get. My fingers get white in the middle and red/ blue ish at the tips\*Do not know about fevers. I don't have a way to take my temp so I am gonna go ahead and say no, sometimes I feel I might but I'm gonna eliminate that\*

Now where I'm asking for help knowing all of this information, I \*JUST\* had bloodwork done ordered by a regular GP  on Monday and am still waiting on my results but most are back now, at least the important ones (RA Factor, ANA, CRP, anti-CPP, ESP)  and these are all negative.  RA Factor was 13, the lab says their ""normal"" range is 0-15...so I do not think that is indicative of anything.ANA just says ""Negative"" there is no way to see my titer rating or anything. It does not say their reference ranges.

With that being said...I'm at a loss, I do not know what to do. I feel crazy, and I'm wondering if it's just normal for everyone to be in this much pain? I know surely it can't be Lupus if the ANA is negative but I don't know if there is more to that or not.  Or what else could really be going on other than  it being in my head. The ONLY other thing I can think to push for is looking in to Osteoarthritis, fibro or trying to push for a rheumatologist referral that I won't likely get, to do more thorough testing (anti-dsDNA, Anti-Sm, Anti-Rs/SSA, immonofluorescent IFA) .But with a negative ANA I don't know if this is worth doing. I do know that the negative result doesn't make my symptoms go away.  I just don't know what to do.

47,31,"COVID 19 Positive Even though, just like lupus, COVID-19, can effect different people in different ways, this has been my experience:

Background information - my lupus is moderate to severe, and I am on a biologic as well as plaquenil. I take prednisone as needed (usually a few times a year). 

I was fully vaccinated this spring and received my booster in September. I primarily work from home, but am in the community regularly for grocery shopping. I see about ten people on a regular basis. Other than lupus, I am not in any other high risk category. 

Symptoms - I started feeling sick four days ago, very similar to the flu. The next day I really felt flu-ish (body aches, fatigue, headache, fever). Yesterday I took a rapid test as well as a PCR. Rapid showed a clear positive, and PCR should be back today or tomorrow but is expected to confirm. 

I’ve been sick plenty with lupus, and yesterday/last night was my hardest experience with being sick, including my worst flares. Cyclical fevers (waking up soaked in sweat), intense headache (specifically, eye pain - yesterday I couldn’t even have my eyes open the pain was so excruciating), and general fatigue and malaise (but being in too much pain to sleep). Muscle aches/cramps, wet cough, and difficulty catching my breath.

I have no doubt that things would be very different if I weren’t vaccinated. I also informed all my doctors and they are arranging an antibody IV which has been shown to reduce severity of symptoms in moderate Covid (also, so insane to think what I have is moderate!).

I definitely would not wish this on anyone, but wanted to share my experience because, even though this is awful, I’m going to make it through. When I first got sick I was dealing with a lot of anxiety being high risk and not knowing how things would go, so hopefully if someone with lupus who just tested positive reads this, they’ll know they’re in for a fight but it’s not a death sentence.",COVID-19,1

49,5,"Help with symptoms?Suspecting lupus. Im gonna keep this short and sweet:
•21 years old,generally healthy entire life

•No history of prior chronic/autoimmune diseases,allergies or reaction to any medication whatsoever

•Generally sedentiary,minus relatively physically demanding job.

•Generally a undereater whole life,somewhat skinny 

•For the past 7-8 months(perhaps even as long as 2 years) I have been getting frequent low-grade fevers.

•So far unable to find out the cause or any apparent pattern;sometimes it happens after physical activity,sometimes i can workout/work with intensity and be fine.

•As time passes,the frequency of the fevers appears to increase - severity appears to be the same.

•I was taking vitamins called IMMUNOGLUKAN(vitamin C,zink and something called imunoglukan)for multiple months,in addition to 1 month of using vitamin B supplements as well.
During the first month of this i had no fevers,functioned normally and thought that vitamin deficiencies vere the culprit;however the fevers came back after some time  and i was still using the vitamin C and zink supplements;i only used vitamin B supplemntation for one month.

•Temperature is usually normal in the morning,then about 16-18h starts to increase

•Symptoms of what i refer to as ""fever""(apologise if i used the wrong term):
- I feel weary,get teary eyed,trouble focusing

-Muscle aches(mostly in the calves,sometimes in upper leg,rarely anywhere else,but always in the calves)

-Body temperature NEVER goes above 37C(98.6F)
Sometimes it is very slightly elevated than normal,but i feel something is wrong.If my body temp is higher than 37C,it happens maybe a few times a year,with strong evidence that it is common cold/flu.When it comes to my 'regular' fevers it is NEVER higher than this.

-General fatigue,increased sensitivity to the cold

When i first realised that the frequent occurence of my fevers is abnormal and decided to visit the doctor(about august this year),i did a whole line of blood works:if i understand correctly,we have ruled out the following ailments:
-Any thyroid related condition
-Leukemia
-Most auto immune diseases
-Hormonal problems
-Cancer
I also never tested positive to Covid-19,in spite of the fact that my entire household has had it twice,been tested positive,and even though i had some general symptoms also found in the common colds,at the same time as them,i never once tested positive.
My bloodwork results,urine tests,throat swabs always come,without fail,completely normal with no sign of anything that indicates any underlying condition.
I don't know if this is related in any way,but for a long time i always have trouble getting up in the morning, regardless of how much i have slept.I usually get good wuality 8hrs sleep,but rarely ever wake up feeling 'energised'.
I am getting really frustrated to the point i HOPE that 1 test comes back with some answers.At this point i would feel relieved even if it was a serious ilness,as long as i KNEW what it was.This 'condition' is seriously impacting my life.I am lucky that  even if my work is demanding,i maybe work only 10-12 days a month,and make enough money that i can spend the rest of the month lying in my bed if i have to,but even if i dont go to work for an entire month,symptoms are the same so i believe that physical overexertion is not in the equation.

I did not get my period for three years and she blamed it on me being overweight (later found out it was due to trauma to my uterus during the accident)

I don't exercise because I barely have enough energy to eat.

I have recently read about the latest variant from South Africa, which could bypass current vaccines... I am about to have my third shot (immunocompromised people need 3 doses initially) and was about to finally come out of my cave, but now there's this? These variants will continue to emerge. If our country was saavy we'd close the borders again or keep mandatory quarantine for travellers. But no. They'll let this variant come in and then be like ""oH nO tHeRe iS cOmMuNitY tRaNsMiSsIoN dAmN"".

77,47,"Just checking in Hello humans of r/lupus

I wanted to take a moment to thank all of you for this community as It has helped me learn about my disease. I truly hope you're all well and able to have a good holiday season. Perhaps I'm delusional or in a brain fog but I've come to think of this subreddit as a safe place to vent my experience with living with lupus and truly express what my life is like.

I've just finished my first meal that I've been able to keep down after about a 60 hour period. I don't know if this is because of my lupus or not. The only other time I experienced this is during periods of extreme depression and/or anxiety. I do not have covid, so not sure what's going on there.

Anyhow, for that I am happy and want to tell you to *keep going*. Little victories make it all worth it sometimes. I read something yesterday that also made me happy, it was ""tomorrow doesn't exist."" For some reason that realization for me was just total bliss. Like, tomorrow has not happened yet, so the anxieties and depression that comes along with lupus have not happened yet.

I feel I'm ranting, so I'll wrap it up. I just wanted to post this so I could feel human and just be real. Sometimes lupus feels like a total dehumanization, and you should feel validated. You have an illness, but you yourself are NOT an illness. You are you. Today I feel strong enough to cheer others on, so that's what this post is about.

Just stay safe, okay?

Take care, friend

78,9,"Severe, ongoing lower back pain--no clear explanation. Ideas? I was diagnosed with lupus and APS at the end of August 2021. I don't want to assume every problem I have is due to lupus (in some way or another). I also know that lupus can cause a lot of different things and is different in different people. But ... is severe, chronic, low-back pain that doesn't respond to a lot of PT and core strengthening exercises err.... even at all common in lupus? Like, could it it be chronic inflammation of muscles in the lower back?

Details: Started in April. Varies in severity, but when it's real bad, I can't bend or even roll over. When I get it loosened, I can actually do a lot. I have always been into strength training and do a ton of core strength stuff. Went to PT just to make sure I wasn't missing anything--- they did all the stuff they would do for someone with disc issues. Didn't help even a little. Now doing a lot of yoga, somatic movement, stretching, trying to loosen those muscles as much as strengthen. No help.

I know I have two minor fissures in discs, but the PT said they should have been addressed by all the PT. And they are minor. 

It's both sides. Pain radiates down the legs sometimes. Nerves definitely involved.

My kidneys look fine so far, so I doubt it's that. 

I was supposed to get a colonoscopy earlier this year for other issues,  I guess when I do that I can see if there's any sort of polyp pressing on a nerve? (That seems extreme, though.)

Not sure what to do. Seeing a neurologist in January. Supposed to do the colonoscopy eventually.  This is starting to feel pretty urgent, but I don't know what the next step is.

But I guess my main question is whether this could just be severe inflammation and nerve irritation due to my body's autoimmune response. ANyone else experience anything like it?  Does lupus often manifest in severe inflammation of lower spine/back muscles?  I mean, maybe this doesn't even have to do with my lupus. I have no idea.

85,31,"Have been on Plaquenil for almost a year and don’t feel any better. I started taking Plaquenil in December 2020 after symptoms and labs suggested I have SLE. It runs in my family big time so that was no surprise. My rheumatologist said my case was somewhat mild in that I had no organ involvement, rashes, or mouth sores. So she started me on Plaquenil 200mg. I still wasn’t feeling well 6 months later and she did labs and said all my inflammation levels had gone down and the medication was doing it’s thing and perhaps it was something else. Other tests suggested I had problems with hyperparathyroidism which can cause similar symptoms to lupus so I saw an endocrinologist and after more tests she ruled it out. 

So I’ve made another appointment with my rheumatologist to get tested again. My biggest symptoms are the terrible fatigue and flu like feeling. I can sleep 10+ hours and still feel awful. I still don’t have rashes, or mouth sores, or bad pain. But this awful feeling of just being ILL has greatly limited my quality of life and what I’m able to do. I also work full time and go to school full time and I definitely feel stress is a trigger for these almost constant flares.

89,12,"Have you had a healthy pregnancy with lupus? Please share. I was recently diagnosed with lupus, but my partner and I conceived before my labs came back, so by the time I was diagnosed, I was already pregnant. The rheumatologist didn’t seem super worried about it and prescribed me hydroxychloroquine. I made an appointment with a maternal fetal medicine specialist which is tomorrow. 

They initially tested me and found 1/160 ANAs and then I was referred to a rheumatologist who tested me for everything (dozens of tests I can’t even name.) My OB threw in some labs as well. I tested negative for everything the second time, including ANAs, except for very slight anti-dsdna antibodies. No smith antibodies, no anti-phospholipids, no protein in my urine. All my nutrient panels were “impressive” according to the doctor. My blood pressure is good and I’m generally athletic, except joint pain keeps me from running now. I have none of the classic symptoms of lupus except for joint pain. He still gave me a lupus diagnosis though. 

I read a lot of scholarly articles online that showed higher rates of miscarriage for lupus patients. I also saw that hydroxychloroquine can reduce miscarriage but increase birth defects. I also saw an increased risk in ASD, learning disabilities and lower IQ in children of lupus patients. 

I feel like the women in these cohorts probably had higher risk factors than I do though, as most people with lupus have more kinds of antibodies and higher amounts than I do. Am I kidding myself or am I rightfully reducing my anxiety? 

I just feel kind of sad and scared and I want to do everything right for my first child, at the same time I feel like I’m otherwise very healthy and shouldn’t have a complicated pregnancy. 

What was your lupus pregnancy like? Did you take hydroxychloroquine? Would you do anything differently?

Update: went to MFM yesterday, she started the meeting by saying “your baby is going to be fine.” She advised against taking plaquenil since I had very low disease activity and had never taken it before. Because my ANAs are currently negative she agreed that we shouldn’t treat something that isn’t there, but said if my joint pain comes back she’s going to recommend it.

I am a 20 year old female. Ever since I was about 13 years old I’ve dealt with chronic fatigue and I easily get sick. Very often I would feel unwell, but could never explain why.  I’ve always had red rashes on my face, not bumpy but super red and hot to the touch. I thought it was normal. I also dealt with heart palpitations on and off over the years, it comes in waves. 

Last month I developed a sudden high fever, severe headache and severe joint pain in my hips. I went to the ER thinking it was possibly covid; tested negative. They thought it was possibly meningitis, spinal tap was clear. My primary doctor ran a bunch of tests, ANA was positive and it said systemic lupus, Sjögren’s syndrome, or systemic sclerosis.

My symptoms coincide with lupus, however I haven’t done much research on the other 2 diseases. My mom and grandma has lupus. I see a rheumatologist on Wednesday.

I’m worried because ever since that “flare up”, I’ve been feeling so much worse than I ever have over the years. I now get joint pain in my hips, fingers, ankles, elbows, knees and wrists. This has never happened up until a month ago. It’s progressively getting worse in the short time frame.  The pain has been almost putting me in tears. I have also been getting severe heart palpitations, much more often and severe than it’s ever been. Its getting to the point where I feel like I can’t breathe properly while it’s happening because my heart skips so many beats. I also keep feeling like I’m getting sick, but I never actually do. It happens every other week or so. I feel feverish and really run down. I’ve also been frequently spotting, with no menstrual cramps what so ever. Not sure if that has anything to do with it.

115,2,"Confusing Blood Work? Hi y’all - my rheumatologist ordered an AVISE CTD panel and I was wondering if anyone here could clear up some confusing results. 

To keep the background short - I had a short bout of myopericarditis (3 days) after coming back from Mexico. Felt great for months after, and then randomly developed inappropriate sinus tachycardia. I’ve had other new symptoms pop up in the past couple of months including hair loss, GI issues, spider veins and other vascular changes. Most people are attributing a lot of it to stress. 

My AVISE Lupus Result was Negative at -1.1. The only positive things were: 

ANA IgG - 28.61 (20-60 is positive) 
Anti-C1q IgG -29 (Greater than 20 is positive) 

Slightly confused because the ANA IgG was positive but my ANA by HEp-2 was negative and no pattern. My rheumatologist (supposedly one of the best in my major city) said he thinks it may be a false positive. 

The Anti-C1q test is slightly concerning though. Apparently it’s significant for Lupus Nephritis. The test is fairly comprehensive and those were the only positive things. 

My last urinalysis and kidney function test was a month or so ago - I try to be proactive even though it makes me look crazy. Microhematuria was the only abnormal thing (3 RBC) so they didn’t even mention it, had to see it myself on labs. GFR was 100 and creatine was also very normal.

I started treatment with my pcp and a GI doctor, who found nothing after an endoscopy aside from inflamed stomach and esophagus. Started meds for that and changed my diet. I got better for a short period, but then symptoms got worse than before. Pcp suggested maybe I had lupus and we did an ANA test that was positive. Then went to a rheumatologist to do more testing. 

I got the results for the Avise blood test on Monday and everything except my ANA was negative. The rheumatologist basically told me that he couldn't help me and to go back to the GI doctor or get a sleep study done to address the fatigue. Totally ignored the rest of my symptoms.

A few months after this my partner left me. This forced me to move back with my parents, the last thing I wanted due to our complicated history. 

I’ve only gotten worse. I’ve had countless hospital stays, my longest 29 days. I’m up to 13 surgeries. I do weekly methotrexate injections, 10 daily meds & monthly infusions. 

I’m still with my parents because I have nowhere else to go. I’m on SSDI and rent is very expensive here. I have five dogs, two from my grandpa that passed a few years ago. I couldn’t even find a place to allow that many dogs. I do all my own housework, yard work, cooking, and drive to my appointments. 

I’m on my second move with my parents now. They decided to build a new house during the pandemic. To do this we would have to live in separate rv trailers on the property. I told my dad I couldn’t do it when he asked. It’s already so hard for me to manage daily life in a 600 sq ft cottage (behind their house). My dad talked a big game how they’d help me with the dog walks and everything. I had no choice in the matter. December of 2020 we moved into trailers. My parents have a super nice 5th wheel with massive windows, a fireplace, king sized bed, double refrigerator. They bought me an old one that’s much smaller. It has small windows making it dark inside. There’s nowhere for me to sit w/feet up, the only position I can sit in, other than the bed. Obviously, no doggy door so I’m constantly letting dogs in or out. 

I can’t use the toilet in the trailer because my parents don’t want to pay for it to be dumped frequently. They rented an outhouse. I have GI problems & often have to walk out to it in the middle of the night. Pretty much everything is just harder in the trailer. 

It’s been almost a year now. During that time I’ve had surgery, head to toe poison oak for weeks, tore 2 tendons in my ankle, and had a sinus infection that took 2 different courses of antibiotics to get rid of. 

Today I got in an argument w/my mom. It started because she said my dad couldn’t start the fence for the dogs until December 7th. I was a bit shocked by this and said I wished dad would’ve let me pay for Lowe’s to do it back when I offered. She exploded at this. Screaming at me and in my face. She said they were in the exact same boat as me. I told her that they are nowhere near the same since I’m sick, have twice the dogs and half the trailer. 

She screamed at me that tens of thousands of people have worse diseases than me and in worse conditions. Then she said she’s sick all the time too and handles it fine. This is news to me as she only has two prescriptions and goes to the doc once a year. My dad said some people just don’t have the mental capacity for it. She said they are building me a cottage so stop complaining. Side note I told them a thousand times I would Live in their nice trailer, if it was hooked to sewer, so they didn’t have to build the cottage.

I would like to start taking it immediately in the morning, but I have a super important event for grad school tomorrow and I'm worried I'll have some sort of side effect that will make it hard to concentrate/think clearly, or I'll get instant moon face and be self conscious all day.

During my first pregnancy my Rheum had me go on Plaquenil to prevent heart block. It seemed to work as my son was born completely healthy.

Anyway, they seem to be preparing to immediately start medication following biopsy results. They have bloodwork to make sure azathioprine wont go south on me lined up.

Dr. Michelle Petri at Johns Hopkins has one of the largest lupus clinics in the world and studies her patients very very closely. She showed no increase #lupus flares after #COVID19  vaccine (228 patients) and lupus infections (31 patients tested). Anticardiolipin antibodies did increase after infection. 

Interestingly skin lupus (cutaneous lupus) tended to improve after infection.

However, antiphospholipid antibodies overall did not increase. This is important, as we know COVID infection can cause deadly blood clots (so not surprising). 

Overall, good news for lupus patients.

197,5,"Medication question Rheumatologist ran additional tests after initial blood which showed positive ANA DS DNA antibody, RNP, and lupus anticoagulant, and positive for HLA-B27. She gave me methyl prednisone for six days while waiting for this blood work and then had wanted to meat in 4 weeks again but her next available wasn’t for almost 10. The methyl prednisone made a massive difference and I felt like a person again. Had some energy, pain decreased, brain fog, etc. all improved. Called the nurse because she wanted an update on how it went after and told her that was the best I’ve felt in an extremely long time but since it’s wearing off things are kicking back in. After a couple days she calls back and they wanted a CT to look at my lungs. Didn’t hear nothing.

I finally saw a Rheumatologist in September and today got at least some answers.  I had a slew of blood tests and x-rays done.  My ANA titers were 1280 homogenous and 2560 nucleolar and my CSR and SED rate were high.  My doctor said it’s definitely autoimmune but shes not calling it Lupus. I don’t have any organ involvement and my blood cell counts are all good.  I’ve had vitamin D deficiency and low wbc counts in the past but they’re good right now.  I have to see a hematologist for the M protein that came up but she said it’s nothing to worry about since my blood levels associated with that are normal.

201,5,"Most detailed, reliable tests for lupus? # What tests have the most precise specificity and sensitivity for lupus (and/or anything else that would be causing my lupus symptoms?)

# My Rheumatology referral was denied because my positive ANA and **positive** (not equivocal) anti-ds-dna were ""not high enough.""  I have 4-5 symptoms on the list. 😑   

My anti-dsdna test was borderline a few years ago, and the most recent test numbers put me into the positive range -- not sky-high, but definitely positive. I have clear symptoms, so *something* is going on. Even if I have just a mild case of lupus (or early-stage), I would like to know what's going on, since lupus can progress, and my increasing symptoms over the last years correlate to my slowly increasing anti-dsdna.  

 Rheum requested more detailed testing before my PCP sends me back.

Does hydroxychloroquine even help?

What other meds are there for Lupus, and do meds help??

Well, you can't run away from stressors of life. 
Just learn to live with it ... rigggght. 

Well my health issues are a huge cause for my stress ... so there's that. 

I'm in my 30s and literally disabled.

206,31,Acceptance issue I came to realize that acceptance of my diagnosis had less to do with handling the pain and discomfort(although that was still there at the top) but it was also the fact that my spirit of who I am needed to be reigned in and caged.

My Rheumatologist doesn't know why there are antibodies attacking my kidneys causing inflammation as she said it is a medical mystery since Lupus usually causes it.

She said my joints are noticeably swollen. She said I still have arthritis. (I'm officially diagnosed RA but thought it was a misdiagnosis when I read about Lupus...guess I was wrong)

She said there is one more test for a rare condition that I have to go over 2 hours away to get done since they don't do it here. She is also sending me to a ""better"" Rheumatologist also 2 hours away. I don't drive a car and have to take public transportation and right now cannot walk and use a mobility scooter so that will be a difficult trip....and I have a 4.5 year old child. 

I'm so disappointed because I really thought Lupus was my answer to everything. 

I'm on Myfortic for my kidneys (she said I have kidney disease) but she also prescribed Hydroxychloroquine for the all-over body pain. For that I am thankful. Even if it isn't Lupus at least they are treating my pain and inflammation.

I had a kidney biopsy done and one thing that came from it was the diagnosis of antibodies attacking my kidneys, making them inflamed. (Immune Complex Glomerulonephritis)

My specialists were then suspecting I actually have Lupus instead of seronegative RA. 

So my Rheumatologist ordered a lot of blood tests to see if any indicate Lupus, and I ""played doctor"" and except for the positive ANA (which can mean nothing) all of my results seem to *not* indicate Lupus.

212,4,"""Urgent"" appointment today, thought it was about a Lupus diagnosis but I saw the lab results and am thinking it isn't...this is triggering my anxiety. So I won't write numbers or say all tests done, but they were typical blood tests for Lupus.

I will also say for 4 years I've been (probably misdiagnosed) as seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis.

First I will start off by saying one reason Lupus was suspected is because according to my kidney biopsy, there are antibodies attacking my kidneys making them inflamed. 

Also, other things like pain all over getting so bad that I'm now using a mobility scooter. (I'm only in my 20s) This pain has ever only gone away with MTX but it caused liver issues. 

Okay, now to the tests:

Positive ANA (like last time)

High Complement Component C3C

High CRP

High Sedementation rate

Protein and blood in urine

High platelets 

High ALT and AST

Abmormal blood clotting (have had 2 DVTs, 1 massive pulmonary embolism, and blood clots in kidney arteries - I now take daily blood thinners)

Those are the abmormal things I can think of off the top of my head. I know you all aren't doctors and can't diagnose me.

Really, I'm mostly just sad that it seems like I'm back to square one and Lupus doesn't (from bloodwork) seem to be my diagnosis afterall.

Yesterday, I noticed 2 blister/sore things on my lip and just though they were pimples. Then my teeth started hurting when I bite down. I have a sore bump on the roof of my mouth, and now I see one on my gums. Maybe that’s why my teeth are hurting. The inside of one nostril hurts (never felt that before) so I think I might have sores inside my nose. The skin around and below my eyes is starting to feel hot and sore. The red, scaly areas of skin on my forearms are feeling irritated. (CeraVe cream helps a little with that.) just now I noticed my arm muscles are feeling sore. 

I’m also feeling a migraine coming on, but I get those several times/week anyway. This time my jaws and ears hurt along with my head.

Among other symptoms.

Anyway, the Rheumatologist last week ordered tests for figuring out if I have Lupus. (Not sure what tests)

She said someone would make contact in 2 weeks to let me know about the results.

Today, less than 1 week after my blood tests, I got a phone call saying I really need to come in tomorrow. Keep in mind they usually do telehealth visits so in-person is a bit strange. 

Well, I have an anxiety disorder so I'm freaking out. She NEVER has done this. I ALWAYS have to wait many months (on average 6 months) to talk to the actual doctor. So I am scared that this is pretty serious.

Last time something like this happened I got told I had Avascular Necrosis and that blood supply was mostly cut off from my hips and they were dying. (Resulting in a double hip replacement)

At this point, 2.5 weeks later, I'm still getting low grade fevers, I still have tenderness and bruising on my arm, extreme fatigue, and body pain.

I have the typical joint pain, swollen lymph nodes, malar rash, and skin issues, as well as elevated liver enzymes and inflammatory markers in blood work, but my periods are also beyond excruciating. Oftentimes I find myself having pre-syncope or syncopal episodes, large blood clots, dizziness, hot flashes, hives, fevers, migraines, debilitating fatigue, vomiting, nausea, painful urination, sciatic pain, and cramps that feel as if someone is taking a 300 degree rusty scalpel and scraping my insides. I also have hot thigh cramps that radiate down my legs, and I’ve even lost my ability to walk.

224,5,"Plaquenil and hypopigmentation I have been taking 200mg/day of plaquenil for the last  year and a half for mild lupus. Plaquenil has stabilized my blood work and I have done well on it. However, I've noticed over the past month the loss of pigmentation (hypopigmentation) on the lateral portions of my lower legs and forearms - these are areas that have tanned over the years due to sun exposure but the darker pigment has given way to lighter patches (circles and ovals).  As of now, it seems confined to areas of my body that have had sun exposure. It almost looks like vitiligo or guttate hypomelanosis, but the white patches are larger in diameter than what is typically seen in guttate hypomelanosis. The package insert for HCQ says that ""pigmentation disorders"" may occur with plaquenil - thus the reason I suspect that plaquenil is playing a role here. One possible complication is that I'm a 67-year-old male so perhaps some of the pigmentation loss is age related -- but it seemingly has come on fairly quickly.

Forty five (36 of whom werefemale) were adults aged over 15. I have treatedthese patients with prednisolone 1 mg/kg andsymptomatic treatment (salt restriction anddiuretics) as required. The patients took this dosage of prednisolone for four to eight weeks,depending on their response and the occurrence ofside effects, before starting to taper the dose.During this period one of the nine men and 30 ofthe 36 women complained of muscle cramps,which were sometimes severe and incapacitating.Initially I thought that this could be related tosalt restriction and the use of diuretics withconsequent electrolyte imbalances. **The meanserum sodium concentration (over the first fourto eight weeks), however, was 136 mmol/ (range133-146 mmol/l) in the men and 133 mmolll(130-144 mmolIl) in the women.

It is a particular type of dizziness here's my best shot at describing it:

* The only trigger I've noticed is not getting enough sleep.
* I don't feel lightheaded or like I'm going to black out. No vision changes
* It doesn't feel like the sort of dizziness that comes with nausea. 
* I've had orthostatic hypotension in the past and this feels qualitatively different. Doesn't feel like low blood pressure. 
* I don't feel like I am off balance *from within*. Rather, it just feels like the floor is sinking. (I mean, obviously it is from within, it's not the damn floor. lol But the qualitative sensation makes it feel like it's the floor that is moving.

259,3,"The Importance of Posture You may have heard that good posture is essential for good health, but do you know why? Posture refers to how you position your body when you’re sitting, standing, or lying down. Your posture is the result of habits formed over the course of years.

Many people may recognize poor posture in others without realizing how their own falls short. If you look around at co-workers at the office, you’ll likely find them hunched over at their desks. Learn why good posture matters — and what you can do to improve yours.

What is good posture?
Good posture is the proper alignment of your body when standing or sitting. Correct positioning involves training yourself to hold your body against gravity with the least strain and tension on supportive structures, such as your muscles and ligaments. Proper posture keeps your bones and joints in optimal alignment and decreases wear and tear on supportive structures.

Good posture reduces back and neck pain
The proper alignment of your spine allows you to move easily so that your body supports your weight without strain. Poor posture can place stress on your tendons, muscles, and ligaments, leading to neck and back pain.

If you suffer from neck and back pain, it may surprise you to know that improving your posture may go a long way in easing your symptoms.

Poor posture impacts digestion
Slouching puts your body in an unnatural position that can impact certain abdominal organs. Stooping or hunching over at your desk or slouching while looking at your mobile device can interfere with proper digestion, increasing the risk for acid reflux and constipation.

If you notice that you get heartburn when slouching, something as simple as sitting up straight may bring relief.

Good posture improves muscle and joint function
When you use good posture, your muscles and other structures function properly, helping you to avoid abnormal wear and tear. Improper posture places stress on your joints and can cause them to wear away. This is the most common cause of osteoarthritis, a form of “wear and tear” arthritis.

While other factors, such as age and genetics, can increase the risk of arthritis, the way you carry your body plays a role in how much stress you put on your joints. Keeping your body aligned in the proper posture can reduce muscle fatigue and strain and help keep your joints healthy and lubricated.

Proper posture boosts mood
When you think about factors that can improve your mood, posture likely isn’t the first thing to come to mind. Look at it this way: Your brain and body have two-way communication, meaning that your mood can impact your posture and your posture can affect your mood. When you’re happy, you may notice that you sit upright, and when you’re feeling down, you’re more likely to slouch or sit in a slumped position.

The next time you notice your mood sinking, try changing your posture; stand up straight, and take deep breaths. You may notice a gentle boost in mood after doing so.

Proper posture improves spine health
Good posture is one of the simplest and easiest ways to keep your spine healthy. While it may take some practice and mindfulness, using correct posture will provide the appropriate back support. This is especially important if you spend time sitting in an office chair or standing throughout the day.

Sitting and standing with proper alignment improves blood flow, helps keep your nerves and blood vessels healthy, and supports your muscles, ligaments, and tendons. People who make a habit of using correct posture are less likely to experience related back and neck pain.

They pain could disappear in one place but start in another (for example after abdomen the pain could appear in right inner thigh). Also it is painful when you masturbate or after that.

The pain was so intense, painkillers and antispasmodics don't work, 3 times I visited ER in 3 different hospitals, 3 times they did a ultrasound and x-ray but couldn't find anything. CT of the genitourinary system didn't show anything either.

268,26,"I wanted to share something positive I (25f) was diagnosed with Lupus a little over six months ago. Aside from the muscle aches and pains, one of my most prolific symptoms was hair loss. 
I've always had very thick, bushy hair so losing it didn't feel like a problem for the longest time because it wasn't making a difference to the total amount of hair I had. I've never cared all that much about my hair and historically maybe don't take the best care of and certainly let it tangle. 
Lately however it's been tangling so much, despite increased hair care, and has become so brittle that untangling it results in chunks coming out. The last few weeks has been causing me so much anxiety as I wash my hair and come back with fistfuls of hair. I spent a week giving it a lot of extra time and effort and finally went to get a haircut yesterday.
The last time I got it cut (the only other time since my diagnosis) the stylist was somewhat hostile and seemed convinced that I butched a quarantine haircut I didn't want to own up to so when I had to embarrassingly say it was a medical condition that was causing the missing hair, she wouldn't believe me. I did not even like the haircut and left feeling pretty bad. 
Fast forward to yesterday and I REALLY didn't want to deal with something like that again so was dreading the haircut so much, but it was either chop it to a more manageable length or slowly pull all of my hair out.
Here comes the uplifting part because the woman who cut my hair was SO kind and careful. I had brushed out my hair that morning but there were definitely still a few tangles at the dying ends that she so slowly and gently brushed out with a comb. When she saw the particularly bad section of my hair, she didn't say anything and accepted when I simply said it was a medication side effect (white lie). She just worked with me to ask what I wanted to do and make sure I was olay with the cut she had to do for it. She really took her time, despite it being a busy day, and was just so kind about everything. I go to a discount chain hair cut place so it's not like I was dropping 50 bucks on this cut but she was treating me better than the times I have gone to a fancy salon.

The amount of kindness and support was overwhelming. Finally felt a part of the lupus community and connected with others going through such similar things. I also helped some too! It was wonderful. Social media was FINALLY enjoyable for me as well as an outlet for all of my suffering with lupus. I actually still text and stay in contact with some of the warriors on my personal page.

A few months ago someone stole one of my lupus posts and she would not take it down. A fellow lupus warrior and friend of mine is the one who pointed it out to me. It took relentless communication for her to finally take it down (I submitted a claim or whatever to make Instagram take it down, told her this, and then she finally took it down). Anyway - it might not sound like much to people or a big deal but I was broken after that and shut down my page. The girl who stole my picture has over 10k followers did not tag me or anything. I know stuff like this happens all the time but I felt violated when it was a picture of me getting an infusion and her claiming she didn't know who sent it to her?! (insert eye-roll here) She did not apologize or have any remorse and it was one of my lowest points in a long time. It put a bad taste in my mouth and now I am so nervous to go back to the community and be reminded that this could happen anytime. I honestly do not think I will be going back anytime soon, sadly enough.

I blocked her, to say the least. But it's sad how something so wonderful quickly turned so disgusting and greedy by a fellow lupus warrior.

I'm also on plaquenil.  I also have steroid topicals for rash.    


Currently symptoms are...  malar rash, some stiffness and joint pain but that seems to be easing up.  Had low platelets so easy to bruise, but not low enough to be concerning such as bleeding etc.  No evidence of Kidney activity or any other organs thus far.    


Before starting benlysta I was on a round of prednisone and did topicals for my rash and it cleared up some.  discontinued the steroids just prior to my covid booster shot and 2 weeks after that started the benlysta.    


My rash is coming back - so I'm starting up the topicals again.

287,9,"22 Female with suspected SLE I’m a long time lurker and first time poster. For background I’ve had kidney stones since I was 5 and am passing a stone at least once a month. My father passed away from SLE at 36. I had a urologist, nephrologist, and urogynocologist for almost the past five years who never gave me a reason for my chronic kidney. I’ve had all different types of bloodwork done, scans, 24hr urines, diets, and collected many stones for testing for years. All I got from my nephrologist right before he retired earlier this year was “it looks like you’re heading into stage 2 kidney disease”. I’ve wanted to give up hope for a diagnosis/cause for a long time. However my PCP is a literal angel. He is the same doctor who diagnosed my dad with SLE when my dad was 22 and has all of my family’s medical history. He is the only doctor who has understood that I should get an ANA test and has been monitoring me for lupus symptoms since I was 16. I’ve had more bad days than good the past two years and it’s getting worse. I just saw my PCP for my annual after getting over pneumonia for the second time this year. I told him all my newer weird symptoms and things that I felt sounded crazy. He previously sent me for two lupus tests but it has been over a year since my last one. During my appointment while I told him everything he had pulled out my dads chart and was reviewing it as I talked about my symptoms. I didn’t know till the end of the appointment but everything I told him mirrored my father’s issues. During my appointment he told me he could diagnose me with lupus nephritis right there but wanted to run one last round of bloodwork just to be 100% sure it isn’t a different autoimmune disease. I got my blood done today and it has completely knocked me on my ass and I’m back into severe pain (flank, back, rash, fatigue, sciatica which is a recently new pain). I stopped counting after I saw 11 vials filled with blood as he ordered every test possible to rule out other immune issues. I’m sad but relieved that I may finally be headed in the direction for treatment. This period makes it all the more difficult as my dads death anniversary is coming up and he was the one person that I could talk to about this and most of all he was my bestfriend.

Best of all, my liver counts (my hepatologist went off of my ALT and AST numbers for this) ARE SO BEYOND AMAZING! Plus, recent ultrasounds show NO liver scarring (cirrhosis) … which is almost unheard of.

299,22,"At what point have you decided that enough is enough? Is there a line in which you’ve decided you no longer want to get treated if it means having to try “x”? Today has been a shit show of a day. Honestly, the past two years have been miserable health wise and consequently financially. I’ve been on Cytoxan since June because nothing else worked. I got a call from my rheumatologist today with more bad news from recent blood work. My inflammation is really bad which is impacting my LFTs, joints, kidneys, colon, and brain. We’ve been doing so much imaging and tests all around including a bone density test which shows that my osteoporosis is getting worse. A part of my tooth even cracked off which my rheum said is probably due to the osteoporosis and/or Sjogrens. 

Anyways, with all of this going down I started talking to my husband about where I want to draw the line. I calculated that I spend approximately 1/4th of the year hospitalized in the past 3 years (when the worst flare up I’ve ever had started). This doesn’t even include doctors’ appointments, scheduled imaging (MRIs, CTs, ultrasound, etc.), infusions, or even blood work. If I had a full time job there is no possible way I’ve be able to do any of this. My veins are also started to get really messed up as every week I’m poked at least twice. I look like a fucking junkie. 

With all that being said and done, I told my husband that if the cytoxan doesn’t work and my quality of life continues to diminish that I want out. I want to stop all treatment, stick with pain management, and just succumb to this disease. This “quality of life” isn’t living and it truly feels like there’s no coming back from it. I spoke to my pain management doctor as well and asked his opinion (throughout the year we’ve become very close and not only does he know everything about my medical history, but he’s the only reason I’m able to walk for almost 20 minutes, so I trust him more than any other doctor). He said that at the very least to take prednisone and/or Plaquenil (prednisone caused osteoporosis and Plaquenil didn’t work), so that he could justify prescribing my pain medication and to continue getting evaluated to monitor my health. He understood me not wanting to try more nuclear treatments, but encouraged me to take more mild medication for all my AIs. 

I know I can’t be the only one out there who feels like they’ve had enough of all the testing, side effects, hospital visits, lack of a decent quality life, and just being tired of this in general knowing that it’s chronic. Forever. For the foreseeable future, we’ll never be cured. The best we can hope for is remission. So, where do you guys draw the line? At that point have you decided that you can’t continue like this and just want a break from all the doctors and treatments? Please don’t misunderstand because by no means am I suggesting, thinking, or talking about suicide. This is purely just stopping treatment, which I understand can very well lead to death, but I am not talking about ending my life by any means. I would just prefer to enjoy my time surrounded by family and friends and travel as much as possible before my body completely gives up on me.

This is my fourth post to this sub in three days. It will also, very likely, be my fourth post on this sub I completely abandon. I don't know what I need and I don't know what I want. I do, however, know that I am stuck in this nasty cycle of shortness of breath, unabashed terror, worsening chest pain and shortness of breath, self-led research and education, and finally back to unabashed terror. 

I am married with children. My husband is not health literate. Even if I did explain the situation, there is no shared understanding of what our future may look like. My only other form of familial support comes from my maternal grandmother who is battling alzheimers. 

I've never been one for self-pity, in fact, I have always felt so grateful that I received a diagnosis because the alternative means both living with symptoms of a disease and having no answers. It has only been recently that I realized how really unfair this process has been. I hate that my neighbor is a 50 something female who has been an admitted meth addict since the 1980s, obsessively uses tanning beds, smokes a pack-a-day on top of her pot habit, and has only ever needed to see a doctor for the occasional sexually transmitted disease. 

I am 30, sitting here with every symptom of heart failure. I've done everything right. I took the abuse and got diagnosed. I've taken all the drugs, kept on top of my labs and appointments. I joined clinical trials. I have a neat collection of hats and SPF 50 shirts. I obsessively wear sunscreen, I use blue light filters and led lighting. I don't drink, smoke, or do meth. I don't sit too long, I eat fruit, excersie, and have been to church. Why am I still sick? Why is my disease still progressing? 

What I think is the worst about it all is the symptom that isn't really a symptom-- the impending sense of doom. It's so strange, kind of like anxiety that isn't anxious at all. It's like the subconscious knows that your body is dying. I've only had it one other time, way back when my breathing problems first started, presenting as some pretty intense pneumonia. I've been having dreams that accompany the doom. Last week. I had a dream that I was having a heart attack.  I was walking around with chest cramping and breathing difficulties. I had asked my husband to call 911 and he ignored me saying that he was going to run an errand. I was trying to figure out how to get myself to the hospital when I woke up from the dream with some pretty intense muscle cramping in the center of my chest. 

While I am a very big advocate for therapy for other people, I have been neglecting myself. A while ago. I decided this was too much and scheduled an appointment. I still have awhile to wait, but am so glad I finally  committed myself to go. I also have an appointment tomorrow for a CT and results of my echocardiogram.

312,5,"Concern about interstitial lung disease/pulmonary fibrosis. Steroids to test for active inflammation? I am seeing a pulmonologist today. I think I have pleurisy, but my bigger concern is that I suspect that I have interstitial lung disease. I have slowly developed shortness of breath during exertion over the last few years along with a dry cough. It feels the way ILD is described. I am really hoping there is no permanent scarring.  Anyway,  I read (in the Lupus Encyclopedia)  u/LupusEncyclopedia that if active inflammation of the interstitial tissue doesn't show up on a CT scan or other test, a round of steroids may be used as a test--basically, see if the problem improves with steroid use. While I really don't want to be on steroids, I may suggest this if the tests don't turn up anything. (I had a CT scan after a blood clot recently and no abnormalities were noted. I think that if I do have inflammation of the interstitial tissue, it's minor. But I want to catch it before it gets worse or causes scarring).

Anyone know how long one needs to be on steroids to tell if the SOB and coughing is due to ILD? And whether it's a high dose?

Also, for those of you who have had ILD and active inflammation: What has worked?

Thank you!

\*Update: Lung scan was clear, although the DLOC was slightly abnormal. Pulmonologist diagnosed costochondritis and said maybe pleurisy, but definitely no ILD. That is a huge relief, but the coughing and shortness of breath is still a mystery.

Saw cardiologist, they said my heart looked fine and it was probably anxiety since I go to school in a city which was a big change for me. These have mostly subsided; I went from back then having multiple a day to now having them maybe one or twice a month IF that.

\-March 2020 moved back home for the pandemic; did online school the remainder of that semester, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021.

\-Went through a LOT of very intense trauma August, October, and November 2020, as well as some more smaller things occurring throughout the rest of the winter. This is when I was feeling nauseous, temp dysregulation, anxiety, pretty much every night. Most of these symptoms are a LOT better now, if not disappeared. If I didn't go to sleep early enough, I would be plagued with extreme nausea, whole body shivering/shaking, chills, intense anxiety, that didn't go away for at least an hour if not more.

\-Moved back to college at the end of August 2021 (about a month and a half ago). This was very good for my mental health and I am mentally doing a lot better than I was for the previous year and a half before that; home is not a very happy place for me.

\-I still have temp dysregulation, but those nights upon nights of just feeling physically ill are a thing of the past. Nausea, chills, shivering/shaking are rare. I do still get headaches from time to time though.

\-Lexapro helped my anxiety but made me gain weight, so I switched to Prozac. Both going on and off Lexapro, as well as going on and off of Prozac made those feelings of ""nighttime sickness"" as well as dissociation and anxiety VERY bad. Maybe the worst they've ever been.

\-I am fully vaccinated and have never had COVID.

\-Non-listed hormones are normal; autoimmune panel was normal; thyroid levels are all normal; rest of metabolic panel and CBC are normal.

\-Most recent bloodwork is from an Endocrinology appointment; recommendations from Dr included: Multivitamin w/ iron + birth control for anemia (I have heavy periods off BC); BECAUSE for painful ovulation and cystic acne; anti-inflammatory diet (gluten + dairy free) for elevated CRP and ESR; BECAUSE and/or weight loss for elevated DHEAS; Metformin and/or Wellbutrin or Phentermine for weight loss.

My biggest concern is that she is just treating the symptoms (anemia, inflammation) when they could be related and have a more serious underlying cause.

Please don't give judgement about the starting and stopping of birth control so much; I am aware that in and of itself is not good for me, but my mother kept trying to scare me out of taking it by doing very sketchy research and bombarding me with it until I changed my mind.

If you have any other questions about other labs or anything like that I can look it up and tell you; I have at the very least a CBC for most of the dates listed in the document.",Advice,0

Does a rheumatologist treat your lupus + fibromyalgia together? Hi there, sorry for the long text wall ahead of time. *I've had SLE lupus with nephritis since 2007, been through multiple flares in that time.* 

However, I'm beginning to think I have fibro on top of systemic lupus. And I'm hoping to get some advice from you all.

 I've mentioned the below stuff to my rheumy two times before but was blown off; he said it could be neuropathy (the shooting pains) but that's it. I haven't pushed or advocated very hard because I feel like ""oh it's just lupus"" but at the end of the day, I've had lupus for 10+ years before any of the below  symptoms started. Also, my lupus is getting better, except for a few very specific symptoms 

**So my question:** if you have lupus and THEN got a fibro diagnosis, how did you navigate the journey? How did you get your rheumatologist to listen, and not dismiss that it's lupus? What do they test for if you have fibro symptoms while also having lupus? Do the below symptoms sound similar to fibro? 

STORY:

In 2016, after several years of remission, I got a c.diff infection that triggered a lupus flare. In 2017, I started dealing with different pain than ever before -- it was also a time that i was HIGHLY stressed (moved across the country, first job out of college, got dumped by my best friend, had relationships issues, my uncle passed away, etc).  

Now in 2021,  the vast majority  of my lupus symptoms (arthritis/ulcers/hair loss/nephritis) have ALL stabilized/almost gone after a year of Benlysta. But I'm still dealing with the below symptoms to no relief. Examples below:

1. Shooting / electric-like pains that migrate all over my body; usually the ""zap"" lasts 30-60 seconds and goes somewhere else. It's not every day, but almost everyday. They are ALL over my body. 
2. When I get over tired, my legs/body are restless + almost like ""crawling out of skin"" feeling. Ex: when laying down on the couch, and my fiance is stroking my arm, after 1 or 2 minutes, my skin feels painful/uncomfortable and i have to tell him to stop touching my arm or touch somewhere else on my body.   
3. I've had chronic left shoulder blade pain for 4+ years; it's aggravated by stress/emotions. I've had multiple scans done + it shows nothing. The pain can be debilitating and even stretches down to my hands/fingers when it's happening. 
   1.  I also have chronic pain in my lower hips/butt night, *only at night*. I'm thinking with the hip pain + shoulder blade pain, it's maybe  the ""tender spots"" mentioned in fibro ?
4. Finally, my **sleep** has been extremely bad for the past year - I always wake up aching and my hips hurt in the middle of the night. I never had this before until the last year or so. Also, my fitbit (which I got in December 2020) shows that I get less than 10% of deep sleep EVERY night for over a year. I have never gotten more than 1 hr of deep sleep for a year. Of course the fitbit could be wrong, but on the RARE occasions when I get 20% deep sleep, I do feel much much better. I've read that non-resortaive sleep is one of the main components of fibro.
5. I have a diagnosis of PTSD from previous trauma, which I know is an overlap with fibro.",Advice,0

Not the first time getting one done but they always suck. I got prepared for one this morning by drinking 32oz of water (actually 48 because I drank 2 24oz cups) within the hour before my appointment. My appointment was at 9 so I had to start drinking by 8. I get there and climb up on the table without peeing on myself. 10 minutes into the scan and having the tech pushing down on my bladder she says she can't find my left ovary (it's happened before). So she tells me to partially empty my bladder. Kinda hard to stop yourself when peeing but I managed it. I climbed back up on the table and we started again. 10 minutes later she still can't find my stupid ovary. So she tells me to fully empty my bladder (thank God). After another 10 minutes and pushing the prob down hard she finds my ovary tucked behind my uterus. Test gets over and done with and I leave the office. Few minutes into my drive my flare up starts and my stomach is sore to the touch. I get home and get an email with my results summary.

A month later after drinking had pink urine and have had it since after drinking. I don't have any pain related to any type of kidney/bladder pain.


I have spurs in my neck so I have also had neck and arm (shoulder/elbow/wrist) pain. It could be due to a pinched nerve too. I seem to get flare-ups when I'm inactive as my job is in construction and as long as I'm moving around and not sitting I'm fine almost all of the time. My left elbow developed bursitis (I'm right handed) a little over a month ago out of nowhere. It was getting better and swelled back up a week ago and now is almost back to normal. My PCP prescribed Meloxicam and I think that helped. He also referred me to a osteopath. Also had more bloodwork and it only showed a slight infection which I have been battling a bronchitis with clear mucus so that might be why.


I also have a butterfly rash which I thought was from the heat. It's been super hot this summer and I sweat a lot. Like a lot. But it's just red. And I'm pretty sure I'm dehydrated as I have been drinking much less water than I used to. We lost our house in June due to a fire and have been staying with a friend. I used to chug 32oz cups of tap water but his tastes horrible and I'm relying on bottled 16ozers I bring home from work.

398,4,"Genuine question: How is it possible to have any level of anti-dsDNA and be healthy/not have lupus? TW: death

Genuine question: How is it possible to have any level of anti-dsdna and be healthy/not have lupus? 

Background: My mom passed away due to lupus complications in her late 40s. She was in the hospital due to kidney issues and got a MRSA infection that went septic and killed her. 

A few years ago I started having symptoms similar to lupus and other autoimmune diseases, due to my family history, I was able to get into a rheumatologist fairly quickly and got lots of testing done. I had positive RF, antiCCP, and permanent joint damage that showed up on ultrasounds.  I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I also have a family history of RA so that didn't surprise me. Honestly, after watching Lupus take my mom away from me when I was still a teenager, I was relieved to have only have RA because I was so afraid of getting Lupus myself. 

Recently I have been having symptoms that more align with Lupus than RA (and I know it's possible to have both) so I am just curious. I have always tested negative for ANA screen. I have tested 3 times and the most recent time was about a year and a half ago. I was looking at old lab work and I saw that I had a low, but not positive amount of anti-dsdna? My level was 2 and I think the weak positive range starts at 20? I am curious as to how it's possible to have a low amount of antibodies, but not have the actual disease? My thought is that it's like if you have fought an infection previously but it is not active you would still have a low amount of the antibodies for that virus. Would that mean it's possible that I once had a higher level during a flare? I have been told that it's possible that I got that small amount of antibodies from my mom because she had been diagnosed with Lupus long before she got pregnant with me? 

I am just curious to learn more about how I can have a low amount of these antibodies but not have the actual disease. I recently moved and I have an appointment with a new Rheum in a few weeks so I am in the process of preparing to meet with them and the questions I want to ask them.",Advice,0

Stiff joints, locked joints, cold hands and feet and tingling from poor circulation, sudden itchiness that I can’t ignore, coughing fits and dry throats, sore all over, weak strength, and low energy that even full 8 hours of sleep can’t help. My health rapidly declined once the first lockdown began since my physical activity diminished from staying at home in my 1-bedroom apartment and also because I hadn’t taken my medicines for 1.5 years. Since then, everyday I randomly get coughing fits where my throat suddenly feels dry and I’m coughing to the point that I’m gagging and burping with watery eyes.

Background- I’m a 35 year old female. I started getting a recurring face rash in early 2021 and the dermatologist ordered the ANA test because he suspected it might be a lupus rash and the test was positive (he called it a “mild positive”). I had never known much about lupus before this but once I began researching, I do seem to have several of the criteria- joint pain, mouth sores, pleurisy, rash, sun sensitivity etc. The dermatologist recommended I see a rheumatologist.

The earliest appointment I could get with a local rheumatologist who takes my insurance is several months away, so until then I’m working with a nutritionist to try managing the symptoms with diet. My question is, what should I expect from the rheumatologist appointment as far as further testing she will order, preparation I should do before the exam, etc? Will she possibly want me to see other specialists after her?  How were your experiences starting this process?

Hi guys, 

To give a little background I’m 25F and I have:

• +ANA low titer (1:80)
• +RF in the past 
• +SCL70 
•Chronic migraine 
• Joint pain that recently progressed from large joints to fingers & toes as well (intermittent) worse on the left side
•Weird patches of dry skin only on the left side 
•I did have a malar rash, it was quite dramatic and I was diagnosed with drug induced lupus. I have subsequently (years later) had my blood tested for chromatin and antihistone antibodies which came back negative 
•I also have pretty extreme heat exhaustion and general fatigue 

The last time my joint pain got really bad and progressed to my fingers & toes, I felt dull achy pains in my extremities particularly my fingers, and my hands got really cold at night. 

Now, the cold hands and dull achy pain is happening again and this time I’m feeling it pretty much throughout my entire body- arms, legs, fingers, wrists, shoulders, but my joints themselves don’t seem to be swollen.

454,36,"Do you feel that you’ve become more sympathetic towards people who think they’re sick or are acutely sick or do you feel that you’ve become less tolerant of people’s complaints? First, a little background. I’ve had AI problems since I was 12. For the past couple of years shit really hit the fan and lupus has made my quality of life decrease significantly. I’ve come to terms with it and even though shit keeps popping up and more procedures and tests have to be done, I’ve accepted it. I’m not happy about it, but I’m also not wasting my energy hating everything that’s going on and being hyper focused on all the bad. 

However, I feel like because things have gotten so bad, I’ve lost some of the sympathy I had for others. 

Since I’ve become diagnosed with fibrosis a couple of years back (and a recent biopsy and fibro scan showed some permanent scarring), I feel like people are drowning themselves in a cup of water if their doctor says to try eating healthier to improve a case of mild NAFLD. I understand they’re scared and sometimes I’ll explain how the liver is extremely resilient and that they’ll be okay if they listen to their doctor and put in the work. Sometimes it works and people DM me saying everything is back to normal and will thank me for trying to calm them down. However, at the same time, I’m screaming in my head that it’s not a big deal and to just eat carefully, maybe lose a couple of pounds if necessary, and your problem will be solved! Some people seriously obsess over ALTs and ASTs in the 40s even when they have no health problems and say how they are going to die young. Like, what??? No doctor would tell you that! 

Sometimes I see posts about people freaking out because they got a “weird rash” (right after having been in the sun all day) and that it *must* be cancer and that it’s impossible for it to be a simple sun burn. It’s as if people *want* to get diagnosed with something and are looking for any excuse to find something wrong. 

Then there are those who *have* been diagnosed with mild cases of some acute condition, but swear it means they’re now and forever disabled. Then they ask how to get handicap passes for parking even if it has nothing to do with their ability to walk, they’re ability to be in the sun for longer than 5 minutes, or anything that’s an actual real reason for needing it. No, Karen, having a UTI doesn’t mean you can’t walk. You might have to take some pain meds and antibiotics at most, but I’m pretty sure you can walk an extra ten steps instead of parking in handicap. 

My favorites though are the self-diagnosing posts with vague symptoms and no proof. I try to never comment on those because they usually have already made up their mind and can’t be convinced that without seeing specialists, they do not officially have anything. I’m talking about the people who *know in their gut* that they are chronically or terminally ill, yet refuse to see a doctor. 

I want to sympathize like I did before, I really do. But after being tested like a guinea pig, having real medical diagnoses, taking medicine that keeps me alive and functioning as much as it can, feeling and having real symptoms (not sun burns or literally a dot on my hand), I just can’t anymore. I’m not saying they don’t have a right to worry because every illness starts somewhere. I’m saying they need to use common sense.

About a year ago I started getting weird symptoms. My knees would swell up life grapefruits and my fingers looked like sausages. The joints in my hands and elbows were so stiff that I couldn’t straighten my arms. Then the fatigue started. I was so tired I couldn’t cook or eat. I’m 5’8 and I went all the way at down to 105lb. Everything I ate bothered my stomach or made things worse. My lymph nodes were so swollen in my boobs chest and neck that they looked like huge grapes under my skin. I got a rash that started INSIDE my fucking ears and spread onto my face. During this time I got divorced (thank god my ex husband is an angel and is still loving and a good friend). The stress of the divorce still made things worse tho.
I started getting recurrent infections and was ok antibiotics for a month and a half straight, that’s when the light sensitivity started. The day after my 24th birthday I got a horrendous migraine. I literally could move my head. I was in the hospital for a week and they ran all my tests. They diagnosed me with lupus and said it was such a classic case that they had medical students coming into my room to study me which was great for them but annoying as fuck for me. I was in so much pain and so sensitive to light I had to wear shades even at night because the hospital lights were causing excruciating pain. It’s been a rocky road. My diagnosis was 6 months ago. As I’m writing this, my eyebrows have fallen out, and I dealt with hair loss. Some natural remedies have worked for the hair loss thank god, but my brows are terrible. I’m skinny and exhausted, and I live in Houston where being skinny is NOT it. People comment negatively about my weight all the time.

- Confusion
- Dizziness

I went to my doctor who referred me to a Rhumatologist. He thought it was lupus so he ordered some bloods. My ANA was negative. As were pretty much all the other tests other than my ESR which was very slightly raised at 20. My Rhumatologist told me it couldn't be lupus because my ANA was negative, however other GP's have told me you don't need a positive ANA. I did have some abnormal liver function tests however they have returned to normal and the doctor thinks it may have been due to a medication I was on.

In my family there are a few auto immune conditions. My dad has psoriasis and RA. My cousin has psoriasis and RA. My great grandad had type 1 diabetes and my great grandmother had RA. 

So far none of the doctor's really know what to do with me and just seem to be sending me around to other doctors who also don't know what to do. 

Is it possible that I have lupus???

(Also have a question about blood tests. On multiple websites it says that people with lupus who test negative for ANA commonly test positive for Anti-Ro and Anti-La antibodies. However aren't these a type of ENA? And isn't ENA a type of ANA or am I mistaken. I don't understand how you could test negative for ANA but positive for a type of ENA.

All my life I’ve had scalp scale patches and in recent months they’ve been on my sides of my neck and I even noticed one on my leg. I went in because I had so much inflammation that my skin hurt to be touched. It felt like my body was about to burst. My face looked unrecognizable, my midsection was swollen like a balloon and my shirt hurt when lightly touching me. I felt heat radiating from my body and when I put my socks on I started sobbing. My ring didn’t fit on my finger anymore and my feet hurt to walk on. My limbs were heavy and I could barely lift them. Sitting in my car was excruciating. Severe night sweats and hot flashes lately.

I went to a primary care nurse practitioner in the clinic the other day because that was my only option. She told me what I’m describing could be fibromyalgia or lupus and gave me a shot of Ketorolac. Then did my labs. I asked if the shot would effect my inflammation lab results and they said no… is was the sed rate ESR test. Ketorolac brought me down to almost normal and I looked like myself again.

Looking for general thoughts on my situation. I’ve been dealing with some sort of autoimmune stuff for years - basically, bizarre things that “can’t be explained” because no doctor wants to believe that anything is wrong. This past year I developed cotton wool spots in one eye, which specialists suggest HAS to come from systemic disease, debilitating brain fog and fatigue, bilateral nerve pain that does not correlate to a known disc herniation, mouth infection/ulcers, muscle spasms, back and knee pain (no swelling), Raynaud’s and nail bed capillary dilation, dizziness and vertigo, to name just a few.  Had an MRI done to rule out MS which was negative. Blood is positive for ANA (>1:640, centromere) + anti-RNP suggesting possible MCTD, and i should clarify that my blood has been like this for a few years, amidst all the other weird and wacky experiences I’ve had. I’m working through with a new rheumatologist now but other specialists think it could be something like lupus. 

My question is how many of you do not necessarily have all the “textbook” symptoms, like the malar rash, for example, but still received a diagnosis. 
This has been going on for so many years but these past few months have been the absolute worst for me so far. I keep being made to feel crazy by doctors, which I know is common, but I know myself (and work in healthcare and generally understand all this stuff!). I keep being told “nope it’s nothing” and then something new/worse happens.

1. If you're on hydroxychloroquine, set up large text and text-to-speech reading on your phone in the accessibility settings before you go in for your retinal scans so that you can still read your messages after they dilate your pupils.
2. If you need to file an appeal with your insurance, save the letter in a separate document to reuse next time they give you grief. Also ask for carbon copies of all of your referrals/labs/scans (instead of one doctor just sending them straight to another) and file them on your computer or in an accordion in case one of your referrals/pre-auths \*mysteriously\* goes missing.
3. Drink several glasses of water one hour before your appointment, so that it's perfectly timed for urine samples and your veins are ready for blood draw.
4. Track your symptoms and/or their triggers with an app like Symple and use the export function to create a .CSV for your doctor or yourself to recognize patterns.
5. Plan to get yourself a little treat after every appointment so there's something positive to look forward to when you're feeling anxious. :)

547,6,"Struggling with mental and emotional issues I have had lupus since 2014 and managed it pretty well until last year when the pandemic hit. The unknown nature of COVID paired with the constant bickering of my parents caused it to flare up. Background: I moved in with my parents 1 yr (from the US to India) after the diagnosis to manage my condition and live the life I wanted. 

They always had a rocky relationship but they made it work for us children. They'd bicker about each other to me every time because I was just there. They'd involve me in their fights for no reason. Before covid, I could brush it aside, travel, and have other ways to vent my frustration. BTW, we have for years told them to get a divorce but they keep ""postponing"" it. But stuck in a lockdown with compromised immunity meant I couldn't really go anywhere. So in 28 yrs of my life, for the first time, I had a mental breakdown so big I was numb and shaken for days. I was yelling so loudly at 1 am in the morning that I could not even feel the air in my lungs. One great thing that came out of it was I made them KNOW how they have hurt me all my life by not considering my feelings EVER, and that even after knowing about my condition, they continued their circus. Since then I have made it a point they know they cannot think of me as a sounding board or their fucking therapist. 

Now their interactions are mellowed out, and I do not entertain their issues with each other. If, after 30 yrs of marriage, they're still together then they fucking better know they have made peace with how their relationship is and not project that onto others. And the hilarious part is they still have the balls to keep pushing me to get married. After seeing this kind of disaster and having lupus, how in the world do they think they're in a position to say that? 

Adding covid + lupus flare-up to the mix, my emotional well-being has been at the lowest. At first, I couldn't really understand what it was, but through therapy, I understood I was feeling emptiness, unhappiness, and hopelessness. And it kept coming back more frequently which scared me more. And since a few weeks, the frequency of 'I just don't know how I'm going to get through this' increased more and more. Again, I broke down during therapy a few days back because I realized **what I was going through wasn't like me**, and that for me is the scariest thing.

My soon to be husband’s sisters caused a huge ordeal over wearing masks to the wedding. They are anti-vaccine and anti-masks. The church has a mask policy which was a huge relief for me because I was going to impose one due to being immunocompromised. It saved me from looking like the bad guy. However, they are refusing to attend the reception. After my fiancé having a major mental health break down over losing his family members and disbelief over their selfishness and my feelings of betrayal and lack of acceptance into the family, him and I have come to a level of acceptance of their asinine behavior. We have decided to forgive them for their selfish behavior but to create a healthy boundary. We will no longer be attending family events at their home, as it is not safe for me or him (he also has an autoimmune disease). Along with their shenanigans and all the stress of making so many decisions in such a short period of time, the stress started to get to me. I also suffer from non-epileptic seizures and thought I was handling the stress well because I was not having seizures regularly.  The past few days I noticed a significant decrease in my energy level, started having chills and hot flashes (thought nothing of it because I had a hysterectomy last year), and my skin is so itchy on my hands and is literally sloshing off on my face, stomach and hands. I woke up this morning and felt like I was hit by a tractor trailer going 80.  I could not move my hands, they were so swollen and sore. Every joint felt like broken glass. Even my elbows hurt. When my elbows hurt, I know it’s bad. I felt like I had all my energy drained like Westley in the Princess Bride. My brain fog was so severe I just stared at the coffee pot, unsure as to how to even begin to make a pot of coffee. I didn’t even consider the fact that the stress could cause me to flare. I can only take plaquenil and medrol because I have a history of Hep B. I contacted my doctor and I am very grateful that she immediately increased my medrol to attempt to get this flare under control.  I have had lupus for a little over 14 years that was triggered by the Gardasil vaccine. This isn’t my first rodeo so to speak. I know I’ll be like this for a month or two. I am grateful every day that I do not have kidney or heart involvement, but I do have CNS and lung involvement and pray my immune system doesn’t attack my lungs this time. I am so frustrated that I flared a week before my wedding and am looking at walking down the aisle with a cane. I know in heart, it truly doesn’t matter, but it’s not what I wanted. It makes me even more angry with this family for creating such an uproar that triggered this flare. I’m just hoping I feel well enough to go on our honeymoon the day after the wedding.

Prior to FMLA my work was deteriorating like always being late, calling sick and an overall confusion of stuff. A task that would normally take 10 mins would take me an hour.  Once it got to the point that getting out of bed was no longer an option I decided On FMLA.

Dermatologist ordered blood work and I had negative ANA and ssb, but positive ssa. She put me on HCQ and tacrolimus ointment and referred me to a rheumatologist. However, before starting HCQ she had me get some baseline labs done. All were normal except my liver and kidney tests came back elevated, but not horribly so. Important to note, for this conversation, that my platelet count was within normal range (146), but just barely.

Two months after starting the HCQ (and my body feeling better than it has in a long time) I finally see the Rheumatologist. We met for over an hour, walking through every symptom and possibility. He felt pretty confident that I had Lupus, but wanted a full work up (like 30+ blood tests, x rays, etc). Everything came back negative including SSA, and the liver and kidney tests which were previously positive. I take that as a sign that HCQ is helping. However, my platelet count is now lower, just barely below normal range at 137.

The rheumatologist is now concerned that there might be a blood disorder involved as well. He wants a hematologist to rule that out before going further with other medications for lupus. Totally understand and I'm fine with that. I have an appointment with a hematologist next week. But I have read that low platelet count can happen with lupus so I'm confused why he seemed especially concerned.

Throughout all this, my malar rash has shown no improvement which the dermatologist was a bit surprised about. And in general, I don't think I feel horrible like I see most people on here talk about.

575,2,"Lupus symptoms/flare? Hi everyone! I’ve been a lurker here for the last few months of my symptoms becoming increasingly more suspicious of lupus, so it’s gonna be a bit of a long winded post.

I have historically had chronic sinus infections, ear infections and tonsil infections my entire life. I have spent the last ~3 years working on getting a diagnosis for Ankylosing Spondylitis, which finally, after a lot of fighting with lots of different doctors, we determined I do have. I was put on Humira initially and I started getting tonsil infections 2-5 times a month, along with severe eye inflammation where my left eye would swell shut, have a burning/stabbing pain and my vision would go blurry for weeks at a time. Humira also severely messed up my period and caused pseudo PCOS symptoms, so it was a very detrimental medication that I had to come off of, despite it having life changing effects for me as far as mitigating my pain and fatigue 100%. I was then switched to Cosentyx and although it is still helping the AS in my spine, it is doing absolutely nothing for me in regards to my other symptoms. I have such severe fatigue that came back as soon as I discontinued the Humira, to the point of me barely being able to drag myself out of bed, some days.

Anyway! So it has been determined that I for sure have AS, that is fine. All of my bloodwork came back positive for AS. I have always suspected lupus in the back of my mind over the last several years of this journey due to a butterfly rash I get on my face every day that I have had since I was a kid, especially after spending more than 2 minutes in the sun. It gets particularly bad after showers as well. I have been treated for rosacea and given steroids and metronidazole cream to no avail. I’ve also had:
•severe breathing trouble and chronic costochondritis for over a year that flares up periodically and will last months at a time
•photosensitivity all over my body but mainly on my hands, legs, feet and shoulders (and face) after spending more than 2 minutes in the sun
•debilitating joint pain in my toes despite testing negative for rheumatoid
•massive swelling in my hands and feet every day
•left eye blurryness and swelling with stabbing burning pain that happens every month for seemingly no reason other than flaring super badly
•massive amounts of hair loss as well as split ends and dry/brittleness that will happen literally a week after a massive haircut to mitigate split ends

My ANA came back 1:160 fine, speckled and my PCP said I also had a previously positive ANA, but other bloodwork checking for sjorgens(?) and other lupus markers came back negative. I did, however, go in to get those labs drawn when I was feeling pretty good and had very minimal pain. For the last week, I have been in the worst flare I’ve ever experienced with a tonsil infection that has gone down to my neck lymph nodes and Eustachian tube, and I could literally feel my eye stabbing and burning yesterday. I went in to recheck all of my lab work because I literally felt like death yesterday, so I’m hoping it will yield some more clear results this time. I am curious if all of these symptoms coincide with those of you who have been positively diagnosed with lupus, especially the eye swelling and hurting with blurry vision? These infections regularly afflict me to the point of me going for a tonsillectomy beginning of October, so I am also curious if lupus leaves people vulnerable to these sorts of infections frequently?

Switched to a vegan diet in early August, and in mid August I decided to try Azathioprine. 2 weeks after starting the Azathioprine, I have a blood test done with my C-Reactive Protein was 3.1 mg/L. It has never been this low. Two weeks simply doesn't seem like enough time for the azathioprine to be effective. Diet is the only variable that changed in this time, I'm wondering if that can account for the decrease in inflammation.Despite the blood test results, I'm still experiencing pericarditis and pleurisy, although I'm at a much lower dose of Prednisone (15mg) now, compared to before (40mg). I decided to temporarily stop the Azathioprine last weekend due to relatively new severe point-specific & pressure headaches, and heart palpitations. Sunday night, it literally felt like the top of my head was caving in, and that was the last time I took the Azathioprine. I'm not entirely sure if these problems can be linked to Azathioprine, but it was the only variable that changed since these events began taking place.I'm really torn on whether or not I should continue to take the azathioprine, not only because of the potential side effects, but because my inflammation appears to be down. Although, I don't understand why my pericarditis and pleurisy are still prevalent. I'm wondering will the pericarditis and pleurisy resolve with time, or do I absolutely need immunosuppressants? I'd really appreciate any input or experiences you all have. Thanks.",Advice,0

But not only my nephrologist said that my hematuria is nothing and that her coworkers have it too, she also asked me if I’m vomiting, because I’m so skinny.
I asked, if my condition is nothing to worry about, at what point do I need to start worrying. She replied: how come you know so much about this? I said: i check my results, and i have google. Then she said it’s pointless and that until I’m swollen, urinating less, have hypertension and dark urine, I have nothing to worry about. 
She asked some personal questions, what my partner does for a living. And I just can’t make a connection how that could be relevant for my medical condition.
Maybe I’m overreacting. Despite all that, she did schedule a lot of additional tests for me. And she is very recognized in her profession. But I left her place very offended and disappointed.

So here goes, 19 months ago I got a referral to a rheumatologist for joint swelling/pain and a blood test that flagged me for potential RA. 
Finally got my first appointment 2 weeks ago. Was sent for more blood test (including Lupus and Scleroderma) and chest x rays. 

Got the results today and x rays are good, all bloodwork came back good, except it came back positive for lupus (forgive me, I don’t know any numbers or names for things). 
But my rheumatologist doesn’t want to rush into an actual lupus diagnosis. He says all my symptoms and the lupus positive bloodwork point to the beginning stages of an autoimmune disease (lupus), but he wants to give it some time to see what happens- if they stay the same, get worse or resolve themself. 
In the meantime, I have an Rx for HCQ to try for 3 months to see if it helps with my joints and rash(es).

I (24f) am early on in all of this, and I kind of feel like I gaslight myself and just randomly end up in weird states of denial. I had my first eye doctor appointment since starting HCQ and just hearing that I'll be seeing another doctor every 6 months just kind of sent me back into an odd emotional spiral. I know the HCQ is working well for me and things are totally more tolerable now but what always does me in is that during those periods where I feel things are great again I tell myself like oh maybe this was all stress/psychosomatic and it's all in my head just for my body to be like ""ha, bitch you thought"" and then I end up entering into a flare (probably from not taking things seriously and pushing myself too far too frequently when feeling ok). It's like I just can't accept it and I'm waiting for my doctor to tell me something was a mistake and there isn't anything wrong and that it's all in my head. I remember after my first appointment with my rheum she asked me towards the end of the appointment how I was feeling and handling what she had just told me and that she knows it can be a lot to take in but it's been 7 months since then and I don't think I've ever taken it in.

It's hard for me to wrap my head around that I'll be seeing doctors far more frequently than ever before and needing to take meds and getting lab work every few months.

Im currently only diagnosed right now with POTS in terms of chronic illnesses. 

My symptoms include daily fever (this has been going on for a couple months now, every day ranges from 100.2 - 100.6, so low grade.) It happens randomly and lasts hours at a time. Tylenol doesn’t help or bring it down. I also get really red on my cheeks that travel down my face, leaving a almost pear shaped gap around the bottom of my nose and my lips and chin. Multiple ER trips & doctors never found any kind of sickness or infection that could cause it. 

I’ve also recently had a positive Sedimentation rate, flagged high. They couldn’t find a cause for that either. 

Other symptoms include joint pain, fatigue, mouth sores, swollen glands in neck on left side, anemia, and a ton of GI issues. I’ve had one partial bowel obstruction, and later an ileus that they caught and turned around before another obstruction formed. I also have had a ton of stomach pain, nausea, trouble with bowel movements and vomiting. 

I’m not sure if this is relevant or not, but I’ve also had 3 positive D - dimer tests in a row ( spaced out ) that each time the hospital couldn’t tell what the cause was, since there was no clot or any evidence of clots that had dislodged or anything. 

I was given an ANA test which came back negative but it was never followed up with any other testing and it has been almost three years since that test, most of these symptoms have happened over the past year, as well as a couple of the positive d dimers and Sedimentation rate tests. 

I’m not sure if this sounds like lupus or if anxiety has convinced me that it is so any comment or advice is incredibly helpful!

i wish i could not be on anything and feel so much better without, but being in the hospital with the worst pain ever has been traumatic enough and i just don’t feel like i have an option. i do not have antiphospholipid syndrome, platelets are fine…
does anyone have a pill they like? i was on seasonique for years and it was the closest i felt to ok, but had mega spotting. i was just on loestrin fe and had so many side effects. 
from my research it seems a continuous dose of estrogen is safer and better for lupus patients (so no yaz or ortho tricyclen), rather than a dose that is varied throughout the month… both to avoid blood clots and to avoid causing a flare.

I have had well-controlled lupus for over 20 years (diagnosed as a teen). I was able to be unmedicated until about 7 years ago, when I started plaquenil, which has completely kept my main symptoms—mostly terrible joint pain and swelling and fatigue—at bay. This last year has been horrible in terms of stress; between the isolation of always trying to be “safe,” the loss of my full social life, and the fact that my job isn’t safe for me right now.   


In my routine bloodwork last month, my wbc were 2.4, which is much lower than my usual. Was tested again on Thursday and they are now 1.9, which triggered a call from my rheumatologist saying that is a “critical level” and that I need to be extremely careful to not get sick. The plan is to basically live in a bubble for the next three weeks and then test again. If they are still super low, he wants to “get more aggressive “ with my lupus treatment/medication. He said this could be the lupus attacking my blood cells. Other than this news, my body feels physically ok—no pain or swelling etc—but I have had a drastic loss of appetite for the last 8 months.  


Just wondering if anyone else has any experience with suddenly dropping wbc counts and what route your doctor took.

She did keep asking about miscarriages, which I told her I wasn’t sure if I had. I didn’t realize this was a question related to clotting because I have incredibly heavy periods with large clots, so I wasn’t able to tell her this at first visit. If I have had miscarriages, I’ve always believed them to be at the cellular level.

My sister, who has PsA, actually thinks it’s probably lupus.

615,9,"New to community/ flare question Hey everyone, 

I'm new to the community here and thought I'd introduce myself. I'm a 32 year old female with Lupus. Like many of you, I was misdiagnosed for years, and I mean *years*. One doctor visit to the next, blood work, scans, etc, before it was narrowed down to Lupus. 

For a while now my Lupus has been at bay. With occasional flares that last 3-4 days, sure it's painful, but I don't need to tell you all that. Somehow we get through it and continue on with our daily lives.

But I recently just made it through one of my worst flares yet. Completely bedridden for almost 6 days. My knees felt like someone took a sledgehammer to them, eyelashes and fingernails even hurt. It sounds crazy I know, but I kid you not, the pain was everywhere. I could barely lift my phone because it hurt my wrists and it took all my energy to text friends or family as the pads of my fingertips hurt to touch the phone's keyboard. So to say the least, it was a brutal one.

But I come here wanting to know if anyone else experiences swollen eyes during a flare? Usually I can tell a flare is coming on if one of my eyes starts to get a little puffy. Then typically a few days after, the flare usually hits, and that eye becomes even more swollen. I'm talking it sometimes looks like I've gotten into a bar fight swollen. This last flare was so bad that both my eyes and eyelids became swollen. My right eye so much that I could barely see out of it. 

Just curious if anyone else can relate to this because after this last flare, I seriously had moments of doubt. I didn't see the light at the end of the tunnel like I usually do. There were moments of wanting to give up because the pain was so intense. And now I'm really nervous what my next flare holds as I don't know if I can handle such an intense one again. Don't mean to sound so dramatic here- but there were moments where I felt like I wasn't going to survive and it was scary af.",Advice,1

621,3,"ANA 1:80, microalbum 33 mg/mol Hi everyone! I had a baby about 18 months ago. I was induced a week early due to preeclampsia. About 3 months postpartum, I started having some tingling down my left side and went to the ER. They ruled out a stroke, did CT and MRI. Told me it was probably just a hemiplagic migraine. After seeing my primary care after that visit, she noted I still had elevated blood pressure (not awful, like 130/85) and protein in my urine. She wrote off the protein due to my blood pressure. My blood pressure regulated pretty soon after but every few months, I get my urine checked and it went down but stays around 33 mg/mol. So slightly abnormal. I also have had costochondritis since having my son along with sciatica stemming from inflammation at my SI joint. 

My OB wanted me to go to a nephrologist before having another kid just to get checked out about the microalbum. The nephrologist said he wanted to check me for lupus just in case. My ANA titer came back 1:80 and pattern nuclear homogeneous. Everything else was normal in urine and blood besides the 33 mg/mol of microalbum. 

I do get the leg pain and rib pain from costochondritis but have wrote that off as my body just changing after a baby and my core being so weak. (I also have scoliosis) I did have a c section and it’s just not been the same since. I also don’t work out like I used to. Sometimes I notice slight swelling when I do eat too much sodium. I also do have thyroid nodules that I am getting an ultrasound on so not sure if that could be the cause as well. 

I am changing primary care doctors because i feel like she has just pushed off all my issues and just wanted to medicate instead of get to the root.

I suspect if I got covid I would be asymptomatic carrier. Without an active immune system it could just take up resistance, have a little vacation, reproduce at will, mutate if it wants. 

Feel like maybe I should talk to a dr about possible weekly home testing. Especially when my daughter is close to having their baby in dec.

Originally I had a negative Ana, so do all my family members with diagnosed lupus but they have a plethora of symptoms and so do I. One day my rheumy wanted to do a serum Ana test to try and rule out whether or not I had lupus, it came back positive 1:140 I think it was, this was 2019. Next year (2020) I had the same serum Ana done and it came back positive 1:640. A couple of days ago my pcp decided to repeat the Ana test and I asked for the same serum test I had before because the other one I was always negative on. She assured me this was the same test.. well it wasn’t the same test and this time it came back negative? But I’m having lots of joint pain, hair loss, malaise and fatigue, fevers, etc so I would think now it would be positive? What is going on? Is it just the wrong type of Ana test?

I know everybody is different so please talk to your doctor about your situation. For reference, I have lupus for about 5 years now and my symptoms have been well managed —except for occasional flares here and there when I stress out or stay out in the sun for too long. I’m still taking medications daily: plaquenil, mycophenolate and Benlysta.

Here’s my personal experience with third dose:

Post-vaccine day- After the shot, my arm was sore and weak. I could not lift it up the entire day.

1 day after- sore arm, low grade fever, chills, nose congestion, extreme fatigue, migraines that come and go throughout the day.

2 days after- Migraines in the morning but I felt better throughout the day.",COVID-19,1

I have a question for all those who have kidney issues (or lupus nephritis) connected to lupus. How did your problems with kidney begin, did your lab results show something very definite from the start or did the disease progress gradually? How did your lab results change during the years, did it start with hematuria, protenuria or both and what was the first indicator that the kidney issues were actually connected to lupus? Maybe kidney issues even helped you get diagnosed?

656,8,"I keep telling people what's wrong with me when they're trying to be encouraging and it's bugging me Hey so

I have lupus and some other autoimmune junk going on. Lately we've got everything all sorted out and I feel so much better, like I haven't felt this good in years. I finally have the energy to do things, like go to a powerlifting gym and do strongman stuff.

But I still have bad days, and flare ups, and weird little moments where I'm fighting something stupid my body is doing and I just can't explain it to people who don't have quite as unpredictable bodies.

And my boss at work and my coaches at the gym a lot of times just want to be encouraging and get me pepped up. I know I do struggle sometimes with confidence. I'm not used to being able to do things. I expect my body to give up on me right when I need it. I spent a couple years where I was so weak I couldn't walk without crutches or a cane, and now I'm lifting multiples of my body weight on my shoulders and shit. It's an adjustment!

So what I've been doing is I'll just try to cut off the ""you can do it"" comments if I end up needing to stop for some reason. I want encouragement and I need it, but I also need to listen to my body. I have to find that balance.

So a few times now I've disclosed ""oh see I have lupus and xyz is happening and I need a minute"" but it never goes over well. I just feel awkward as shit (I don't like telling people what's wrong with me) and my coaches take it as even more reason to encourage me when they think I can handle it.

Expected effect = ""oh yeah let's let you rest a minute because you're not BSing me to get out of your work""

Actual effect = awkward silences, ""you can do it"" continues

658,63,"Anyone else go through years of symptoms in their teens where everyone they reached out to about them brushed it off as being lazy/overdramatic? I'm going to start this off by saying I've(26f) never been the type of person to want others pitying me or worrying about me, so when my symptoms first started I ignored them. I brushed it off, myself, as stress and nothing more. My hair started falling out (though it's always been thick so even losing handfuls throughout the days would go unnoticed by everyone but me), my joints had already been hurting consistently since middle school, and I was finding it harder and harder to stay awake. I was struggling to do basic things like my chores. I begged my dad to take me to get it checked out, he said it was probably nothing and to just start going to bed earlier (I was already sleeping 9-10 hours a night). I talked to teachers and the school nurses and they all thought it was growth spurts or me trying to get out of class. Years of various adults would always ignore and dismiss my pleas because ""there's no way a child your age is actually hurting like you claim, so stop faking, so being lazy and grow up. Just do your chores and stop complaining"" (I was about 12 when this was said to me, and it stuck with me because it was said by my own father, so naturally it devastated me)
Once I was old enough to drive myself (and thankfully had a doctor I could go to any time without paying through my father's job at the time) I went to them. They theorized mild arthritis, depression and anxiety (which, duh! I'd been told my whole life that I was overreacting when I had been in constant pain the whole time). I then spoke with my cousin (who is an RN with a step daughter with lupus that also went undiagnosed for so long she went into renal failure before they realized and ended up on chemotherapy for a while but has since recovered and lives a happy full life) about my symptoms. I had spoken to her before but she didn't have the experience with it yet and didn't make the connections back then. She sat with me and finally listened in depth to everything I've gone through and experienced. She suggested I request an ANA test be done. No theories, just that I need to request that specific test. I did and it came back negative so the autoimmune disorder continued to go undiagnosed. I kept up my complaints and research. I kept talking to my cousin as well about it because I finally had someone who listened and understood something really was wrong. Every time my doctor's office would switch professionals(they rotated, as it was technically an on site clinic for the employees and their families at my father's job) I would request that ANA again. It came back negative so many times but I just knew I had to keep asking. I know autoimmune disorders can present even with a negative ANA) I started having neurological symptoms. I'd zone out, lose time, and my anxiety and depression deepened. I felt like I was losing my mind. I brought the loss of time to my newest provider (same office, she was just a newer hire and to this day I believe she is the most professional and most amazing doctor I've ever had) and with that added to my other symptoms and the consistent ANA tests, she decided to try again. This time my ANA was positive and I showed positive for Lyme disease (which, as us lupus warriors know, lupus often causes false positives for Lyme disease). She put me through the mandatory treatment for Lyme disease, just in case, and referred me to a rheumatologist who confirmed I have lupus. A month after my diagnosis (bless that sweet doctor and my new rheumatologist) I found out that the time loss and zoning out was absence seizures, as I ended up in the ER after having a seizure while driving to work. We still haven't figured out if the seizures are actually connected, but I've also been officially diagnosed with epilepsy as well. Needless to say, my father and every adult I maintained contact with that always brushed me off suddenly felt very ashamed for it. 
I guess my point is... if you think you have lupus, no matter how many people doubt you, keep fighting to get the right diagnosis. I've been diagnosed and treated for a year now and, while I still get flare ups during especially stressful times, the hydroxychloroquine helps. It helps so much, my pain levels are minimal and I feel more human than I have in the 16 years it took to get diagnosed. There's hope, always.",General,1

I have just been reading a lot of comments about how Lupus is so hard to diagnose and it can take years and years of suffering.  That it can't be diagnosed through a blood test. And that if Im given a Lupus diagnosis so suddenly then the doctor is just guessing.

I had rashes all over my body and was seeing a dermatologist and started having joint pain/weakness 10 months ago. i was referred to rheumatology and he diagnosed me right after bloodwork came back with pos ANA and anti-smith.

661,8,"Keeping silent on health issues? Do you ever not tell anyone about other health issues that you have because you feel like you are being judged? I think that my family probably says that it's always something wrong with me and shruggs me off most of the time. Before I was diagnosed with Lupus,  I found a breast lump. Ultimately it was discovered to be Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia. Having ADH increases your chances of developing breast cancer. I also have very dense breast which makes it harder to identify cancer on the mammogram.  I have no family history but I'm considered high risk.  So every 6 months I have to  either get a MRI or a mammogram and I've been referred to a Breast Cancer Dr to discuss my options which ranges from being on more cancer drugs with 6 months screenings,  I'm already on Methotrexate.  Or get a prophylactic mastectomy.  I have bad anxiety and worry a lot.  I  feel alone and ashamed alot. I'm trying not to scare myself but it's so hard.

662,9,"Flares & Scares 20yr F - Currently Working Part-time and School Full-time

Hi! So this is like my third time posting in the last few months, but life is not getting any better for me at the moment. I have had two flares within the past four months, but the down time in between was nothing amazing as I was tapering of Prednisone.

New symptoms have arisen that include:

* chest pain
* hair loss (resulting in a bald spot on my temple)
* shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing
* dry eyes and mouth
* serious stomach issues that impact daily life

This is all in addition to my symptoms that started in May of 2021. Those symptoms include:

* migraines
* vision changes
* increased fatigue
* increased anxiety
* light sensitivity
* joint pain
* appetite changes

Not to mention so many others that I can never remember because of the brain fog.

Last night the chest pain got so bad that I went to the ER after days of debating with my mom & bf. I was diagnosed with pleurisy, and was given multiple tests/scans due to a concern of blood clots in my lungs (still a possibility). They noted tachycardia in my chart, as well as myocarditis, both things that need to be taken seriously in lupus patients. I was given a CT, X-ray, and a three day dose of 40mg Prednisone.

I was waiting to get into my rheum until October, but I called this morning and they are finally getting me in on Tuesday (sept. 7th)! I am so excited, but still incredibly anxious as I am worried I won't be taken seriously as that has already been happening quite a bit with my doctors.

I have been working with the disability services at my university, but there is only so much they can do.

I have had neuropathy and pain in my legs for years. I was diagnosed with a severe B-12 deficiency. I also have gastric issues that they have never been able to explain. Each time we would test and test and eventually the pain would get better…for a while. I have redness in my cheeks that gets worse sometimes. 

Last week I got a migraine Tuesday night. Wednesday I woke up extremely weak. I took my blood sugar level (I’m not diabetic but have had common diabetic symptoms for years). My bgl was 71. I ate and drank juice and peanut butter. I kept testing it and could never get it above 75. I felt like my arms and legs were stuck in sand when I walked. I had to lean against trees when taking my dogs outside. My fingers started swelling. 

Thursday I went to my PCP. My bgl was 51. My blood pressure was super high and I had an abnormal ekg. I couldn’t talk, my brain was extremely foggy, and I was just spacey. I lost all feeling in my hands and feet. They turned blue and stone cold. She sent me to the ER. They did four tests (counting a pregnancy test) then told me they didn’t see anything life threatening and sent me home. I was miserable all weekend. I started having abdominal pain, pain in my shoulder blades, up my spine, and severe dizziness. 

Monday I had a CT scan. It showed enteritis. My doctor sent me to the ER. I spent 12 hours there for the doctor to tell me he didn’t see anything wrong.

How do I ask as nicely and politely as possible about these details of the wedding? Is me asking at all just rude? I wasn’t going to ask the bride, I was going to talk to my aunt who is the MIL and a big part of the planning.

There's no swelling or stiffness. The imaging clearly shows that the plica is inflamed and thickened. When it's really inflamed, it gets pinched when I bend my knee and causes a knife sharp pain. The pain had never gone away entirely since this began over a year ago, but it varies considerably. When it's bad, it hurts to walk and I need to go down stairs backwards, one step at a time. When it's relatively okay, it's tolerable and I can do a lot of stuff. Jogging and lunging is always out of the question, though.

It seems to be from systemic inflammation (other causes ruled out, it's not an overuse injury and no amount of rest or PT has made a difference, and it started suddenly in both knees simultaneously) so I accept it's a symptom of my Lupus.

About five years ago I started experiencing flares which have taken the form of intense fevers with chills and aches, and in one case fever and ITP--platelets went down to nothing. No other symptoms.   


In the Before Times it was fairly easy to convince my docs that I needed a three day round of pred to knock out the flare. In Covid Times, they have been extremely bearish about this. I'm negative for covid and live in fairly strict isolation.

And I know the easy solution is ""just change doctors"" but there are two rheumatologists in the area my insurance will take and the other one isn't accepting new patients.

But trying to make a very long story short I feel like she's done fuck all apart from prescribing HCQ in the time I've been seeing her.  Her usual response to everything is ""Yeaaaah that's just what this is like.  Come back in three months.""

She's given me no suggestions for dealing with the pain.  She didn't warn me that allergic reactions would trigger lupus flareups in spite of a ridiculously long allergy list in my chart.  She told me I couldn't do anything about the rash on my feet which itches like I stepped in an ant's nest - my primary care doctor was seeing me for something unrelated and said ""Wow that's bad! Let me prescribe you something for it.""  It cleared up in a few days and I'd had it for two months.  She told me the fact that I've literally become a shut-in because the HCQ makes me crap myself unexpectedly ""just means that it's working.  You should increase your dose."" (Spoiler alert: I didn't)  My GYN was seeing me for my annual visit and my joints were ridiculously swollen and she said ""Why aren't you taking your rescue meds for your lupus?  Don't you have prednisone?""  Fucking what???  No...my rheumatologist never mentioned this, why is my gynecologist telling me about it??  I complained about the pain yet again and the rheumatologist told me I should just be thankful I only have joint issues and no organ involvement.  Which...yes I'm VERY thankful I know lots of folks have it a lot worse but that's not helping.  And finally she ran more blood tests which were much worse than the last ones and when I asked her what it meant she got kind of snappish and said ""It doesn't mean anything!""

I was seeing my primary for a follow-up last week and I wound up ranting about it to him because I feel like this is completely taking over my life.  And his response was ""Well the thing with autoimmune stuff as I understand it is sometimes there's not a lot you can do.""  Ok I get that.  I don't expect her to have all the answers.  I don't expect her to make me 100% again because I know that won't happen.   
 But I feel like trying one drug that makes me shit myself uncontrollably and providing no other information or suggestions is bullshit.

Apparently that's the only medication they can give me for my Sjogrens and I'm extremely upset.

691,6,"Questions to ask at Rheum appointment? Advice on what could help? I’m lost.. Hi All,

  
I want to thank everyone who has contributed because I have found this sub comforting and helpful throughout my medical process. I am unsure what to do and wanted to seek advice and possible guidance? 

\*\*\*Mods, I am not sure if this is the right thread or not.

I have been dismissed constantly by many doctors and specialists. I don't normally post, so I wanted honest feedback/advice. I'm going to try my best to quickly list what has happened to give you an idea of what they have found so far:

  
\- I had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, HIDA scan, MRI, and two ultrasounds done within the past few months. I have also had a lot, and I mean A LOT of bloodwork done, so my arms are still bruised and swollen because of how often I am being pricked.   
\- Results for colonoscopy came back basically normal. Endoscopy showed that erosion in the duodenum had esophageal stenosis (benign), and flattened mucosa was found. I do not have celiac, and from my colonoscopy, I don't have Crohn's or anything else related. However, I have continued to have extreme bloating and pain.   
\- HIDA scan showed that I have a hyperkinetic gallbladder, so my gallbladder doesn't work. They are not considering surgery now because I am still dealing with basic G.I. issues that I am currently trying to treat. However, they are requesting another endoscopy to make sure the medication is working.  
\- Blood work for b12 came back abnormal, and I was deficient. My ferritin levels and monocytes were also low. I also have a high WBC, and there isn't a clear cause. They tested my CRP (14.6) and ESR (21), and both were elevated. Additionally, I have high cholesterol now (not needing medication), am insulin resistant (discovered I have PCOS), and slightly elevated testosterone levels.   
\- I did have cysts on my ovaries (the PCOS diagnosis) and a benign tumor in the uterus wall.   
\- Rash on my scalp and I have a lesion on my arm, as well as confirmed hair loss (unknown cause)  
\- Eye rash that my PCP claims could also be autoimmune-related  
\- Sinus tachycardia also awaiting further workup for heart palpitations

  
However, this doesn't explain many other symptoms I am still experiencing, and many doctors suggested I see a Rheumatologist. These symptoms are:

  
\- Face rash that comes and goes, usually on my cheeks and across the bridge of my nose. I also get random rashes on me that appear out of nowhere. I suspect I am intolerant to heat or the sun, but I am not sure, so I have been trying to pay closer attention.  
\- My vision seems to be impacted. Sometimes my eyes move rapidly (involuntarily) while I am just minding my own business. Sometimes have pain behind the eyes.  
\- I had headaches every day for two weeks straight and, in general, have had a lot of headaches.  
\- Sometimes my hands shake too much that I can't grip things and drop them often.   
\- I also get rashes that burn on my hands and feet that look almost blotchy.  
\- Hands, wrists, fingers, and ankles swell and sometimes are stiff. They also hurt, and I can't usually even hold my phone. Unfortunately, this has been happening more often.    
\- I urinate a lot at night, sometimes have burning, but not often. Sometimes it looks super dark or foamy despite how much water I drink ( I mainly only drink water).   
\- Body aches and pains all over. One in particular that gets bad is my left side to the point that I can't even walk, sit, or even lie down. It becomes so painful and stiff.   
\- Feeling dizzy when walking or standing, feeling like I am being ""pushed down"" from the top of the head. Idk how to describe it, but it doesn't feel normal.   
\- My lymph nodes get so swollen/they hurt that I can't lift my arms sometimes, specifically in the armpit and groin areas.   
\- Stuttering that has never occurred ever in my life and constant brain fog. I can't think or formulate anything.   
\- constant fatigue and lower back pain or neck pain  
\- mouth sores that appear on my tongue or in my mouth  
\- Night sweats

  
I am sure I am forgetting other things, but I don't want to be dismissed at my appointment and do want to be taken seriously. I am scheduled with a PA-C in November, virtually. What do you suggest? What should I ask for? I am seriously starting to lose my mind and need any guidance or advice. I don't know what could be going on, and I just want to treat the pains.

694,0,"Looking for advice from those suffering autoimmune (or who are very familiar with them) Just wanted to ask for general advice from those either suffering from lupus/autoimmune issues or perhaps have a much better knowledge of it than I. Apologies in advance for this will certainly be lengthy as I want to try and get as much information that may be relevant included. 

I’ve generally had some of these symptoms for several years, mostly manifesting in my later teen years. However, I have noticed a drastic increase and addition of symptoms as a result of appendicitis and peritonitis that occurred in late 2019 whilst I was abroad. Following a return to the UK I went through a four month period of severe night sweats, chronic pain in joints, muscles and chest, sudden weight loss, fatigue and what I perceived to be flushing on the central portion of my face/nose. Thankfully, I was able to improve health wise but do not feel since the incident I have fully recovered. One of my main concerns has been lupus or autoimmune-related issues, which were only brought to my attention due to the ‘flushing’ on my face. My other symptoms which have caused concern include;

\- Mouth ulcers. I have always been someone afflicted with ulcers, particularly when unwell. However, they’re far more common now and often find themselves in areas where no teeth-related trauma could have caused them (under the tongue, back of the throat, the outside of my lips,  roof of mouth etc.)

\- Joint and bone pain, strangely more so on the left side of my body in fingers, knee, hip etc.

\- Kidney infection – twice in the left kidney last year which was thankfully mild and did improve after a long course of antibiotics and painkillers. 

\- Stomach issues, which are by no means new to me. However, this year I’ve now become accustomed to having acid reflux and globus sensation, something that I hadn’t experienced prior to January 2021.

\- Migraines, which my doctor has also referred to as ‘cluster headaches’ due to the pattern they follow. Typically deal with by laying in a quiet darkened room, with tiger balm being the only thing that offers any sort of relief. I do have two benign brain tumours, which were ultimately diagnosed as a result of my GP doing an MRI to look into the headaches. I’ve been assured that the headaches are not to do with the tumours, which my GP/endocrinologist are in agreement would be too small to cause any significant pain (I tend to agree with them). 

\- Sudden onset fever/feeling of malaise or flu-like symptoms. This is harder to explain, but randomly some days (typically late afternoon) I’ll feel like I’ve developed a cold or flu, and will follow the process of drinking lots of fluids, taking paracetamol or whatever OTC remedy I have… and then bizarrely by the time I wake up the next day all symptoms have vanished. These weird flares off ‘temporary’ illness typically cause me to flush badly, severe migraine, high temperature, blocked nose/sore throat and swollen glands. I cannot notice an obvious pattern of what causes these, but it’s typical I get them after a day involving a lot of activity/travel (particularly prevalent when going to and from work). 

\- Central erythema which I initially believed was rosacea. Neither parent in my family has rosacea, but I had assumed rosacea based off it fitting the description for Subtype 1 (telangiectasia, symmetrical redness which initially came and went but has over time become more permanent due to strained blood vessels). The area itself feels warm, and I do my best to keep it out of sunlight/avoid stereotypical rosacea triggers. 

A follow up with my doctor several months ago led to them asking to see a picture of the rash, which worried him as he felt it fit (in his mind) the appearance of a ‘butterfly rash’. This combined with several family members having autoimmune issues (celiac disease, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis) enabled him to send me for several blood tests. The doctor had told me that one test (celiac) came back negative, which was of no surprise to me as I’ve never noticed an issue with gluten. He also had put me down for an ANA, which I never received the results for but am of the belief it was negative. I am uncertain as I had to call the surgery weeks after to request the result, only to find out the doctor in question had move practices, but I was informed by the secretary that as far as she could see on my notes “all normal”. Months later though I still find myself afflicted by the above symptoms, and it is really beginning to take a mental toll on top of the already strained physical pain such symptoms provide. I am due to start a new career at the end of September and really want to get a jump on any medical follow ups I should be looking into, and primarily I cannot shake the autoimmune/lupus angle despite the supposed negative ANA. I do know that many individuals with autoimmune issues (a family member included) go undiagnosed for years, and whilst I’d like to say I’m free of any such condition, I also want to ensure I am doing right by my own health if that includes not being satisfied by my current situation and what I feel at times is a lack of interest from my local general practitioner/s. 

My main questions would be

Would I be wrong to completely accept autoimmune issues (lupus in particular) are highly-unlikely if this first ANA as far as I’m aware has come back negative? Are my symptoms even remotely similar to what anyone here faces? Or perhaps hallmarks for other conditions/illnesses that I’m unaware of? I feel the more I know or am prepared with would certainly make the managing of this strange health-episode easier. Many thanks to all in advance!",Advice,0

696,12,"Recently diagnosed, question about photosensitivity Hi everyone. I was just diagnosed with SLE (and secondary APS). I have never experienced any sun sensitivity thus far. In fact, I've always tolerated sunlight relatively well. I always wear sunscreen and a hat to protect my face (I'm prone to hyperpigmentation on my face only), but regularly walk in 90 degree heat in tanks and shorts. I LOVE the sun and the heat and tolerate it very well. I hydrate, but I never find it to be too much. I do try to always wear full body sunscreen and after this diagnosis, will be religious about this.

**So, here's my question**: Is it possible that the sun is causing flares and damage even if I don't experience sun sensitivity or rashes after being in the sun? That is, might I be harming myself by spending time in the sun without realizing it? I know that I may suddenly become sun sensitive when I wasn't before ... I think I'm in the early stages of SLE. (Just started hydroxychloroquine and hoping this will help to prevent things from getting worse.)

**Here's another way to put the question**: I know that not everyone with SLE is photosensitive. But are the UV rays especially bad for all people with SLE, including those who do not have any obvious adverse reaction?

I'll be super religious about sun protection all over my body regardless, but basically I want to know if it's foolish to walk in the heat in tanks and shorts even with good sunscreen covering my body. I live in Alabama, so it's pretty hot here.

I should say, the reason I'm reluctant to cut back on my ""outside time"" is because, like many others, I find that being outside in the light--especially walking or exercising in the light--really helps with depression an anxiety. I work near windows whenever possible to try to keep my mood up. I'm having a bit of trouble dealing with the SLE and APS diagnoses and don't want to make things harder on myself by avoiding sunlight unnecessarily. I'm hoping that good sunscreen and maybe some new protective clothing will be sufficient.

I have always had issues with my heart but never too serious. Twice I had small heart attacks and my cardiologist wouldn't know why. Then diagnosed with peridarditis, my cardiologist notices liquid around my heart —again, bc I had the same problem couple years before. Nothing too serious, but couldn't breathe properly for the next three months, then hospitalized for 10 days with normal blood tests but severe joint pain, hot waves and sweatness from nowhere, extreme fatigue and of course my heart problems plus the fact that my heart was REALLY aching, like I thought I was going to pass out—to be clear, I started with those symptoms before those horrible three months. Left the hospital without a diagnose, but a month later at my doctor's appointment she says ""it may be lupus but I need a more time. Give me some months"". Now waiting for the next appointment —end of this month.

with all of this I was like ""ok, this is nothing too serious"" but God it is. I can't go back to the life I had before. I used to volunteer a lot, I took horse riding lessons for 10 years, I did competitions, I walked to everyplace instead of going by bus or car or whatever, I had a pretty active life and now I feel like I can't keep up with the day. If I meet with my family or a friend —just a normal meeting like a dinner, or lunch or even going to my aunt's house to stay with her for the afternoon just chatting—, I need to rest DAYS before and DAYS after in order to prepare my body for a couple hours out, like I can't do ANYTHING and I'm pretty stressed with myself. I've been having other health issues too along my life and I feel like my mum doesn't deserve this and I really struggle with s\*icide thoughts bc I don't want my mum or family to suffer again because I'm ill. And of course, I have no one to talk about these things bc I do not know a person with lupus or any other autoinmune disease! because yes! I have one for sure that has no cure but nobody knows if it is lupus or what!

still figuring out that last point, knowing that I got to live with a disease is not something you learn at school or that your parents teach you or prepare you to fight...

698,7,"ANA Results Question - Recently Diagnosed I am recently diagnosed with lupus, and have a questioned about ANA Results.

I have chronic kidney disease and back in January my new nephrologist wanted to see if she could figure out the underlying cause of my disease. She ran a bunch of labs and everything came back normal and I didn't think much of it. Fast forward to this month and I was diagnosed with lupus and my rheumatologist said that lupus could be the cause of my CKD. 

I didn't think to ask him at the time, but on a whim went and looked at the labs my nephrologist did in January and she had checked ANA and it was negative. The first panel done my by rheumatologist showed 1:160 (speckled) in June and the second panel (Avise CTD) showed a titer of 1:320 (homogenous) in July. Obviously I can ask him when I see him again next month at my follow up, but I am really curious if it's ""normal"" to have a negative ANA and then 6 months later be positive? 

He said he would request the records from my nephrologist so he would have them for my next visit, so I am sure he will see this as well.

I have been having symptoms off and on for about 9 years so it just seems odd that I would have had a negative ANA in January if I have lupus. 

I guess I am just questioning if I have the right diagnosis, and if this has ever happened to anyone else. 

My Avise CTD showed positive (tier 2) for lupus, and that coupled with other labs and symptoms led my rheumatologist to diagnose me with lupus. I did have a large number of visits (with him, my GP, and a few other specialists along the way) leading to my diagnosis. At my first visit the rheumatologist said that I might have fibromyalgia, as I don't have any rashes so he wasn't initially thinking it was actually lupus.

Becoming more and more common, it's a whole thing. I am so excited to know her. We are meeting in person for the first time next week. 

She has Lupus and I want to show her love and support with kind gifts and such, spread over time. I'm also making up for 40+ years of missed birthdays, holidays, etc.

702,13,"this sucks as we all know, lupus really sucks. having a doctor who isn’t too concerned is even worse. really getting hopeless and upset with the lack of care i am receiving from my doctors. 

I’ve posted here before about my symptoms and solutions of pain relief, but so much has changed since then. 

Started out with horrible joint pain, eye twitches, memory fog, brittle nails, nose sores, migraines, and some blood tests with an ANA of 640. Fast forward three months and I have done a week and a half round of taper dose prednisone and am now back to celebrex. The prednisone WORKED! But, my doctors took me off, understandably as steroids can be overwhelming for your body. I have started experiencing more symptoms like dry eyes, dry mouth, hemolysis, frequent UTIs, hair loss, difficulty swallowing/choking, and breathing/lung issues that my doctor believes is pleurisy. After messaging my doctor this week about my experience post-prednisone, she advised vitamin d… a supplement I already take and that is noted in my chart. I switched to this PCP after being told to just “rest and eat right” while waiting five months to see my rheum. 

I quite literally cannot function like this as a 20yr old female and have no clue what to do anymore. Does anyone else have experiences with PCPs completely ignoring you or your symptoms, especially after a treatment was found to work? I don’t see my rheum until the end of october.",Venting,1

704,3,"Questions to ask at my next appointment Hi! I am a 26(almost 27)/F and I think I might have Lupus. I have another doctors appointment in 3 weeks and was curious of what I should ask my Doctor to do in regards for testing me for lupus/autoimmune disease. I’ll put my symptoms and story below ⬇️ 

For the last few months I’ve been experiencing hot flashes and episodes of increased sweating when doing things that have never made me sweat before (walking around walmart, etc) I told my doctor and he ran blood tests and thyroid panel and it came back normal. I later switched my SSRI and got more blood work done with early menopause. The sweating continued and my blood work continued to show no signs of anything out of the ordinary. 
 
I soon began to experience joint point that was A LOT more noticeable on my dominate side. The pain was in my shoulders, fingers, knees and in my hip. My muscles also felt sore and kinda weak. I’ve also been having mild heartburn and some chest/underarm pain. (Ive checked for lumps and haven’t felt any) and I’ve noticed my nails are starting to look brittle.

Finally saw a rheumatologist this Wednesday and they really aren’t sure whats wrong with me as my bloods are normal.

706,6,"Is enthesitis one of your symptoms? An enthesis is a point where a tendon or ligament inserts into the bone. Enthesitis is when this area becomes inflamed. Classic examples of enthesitis include: plantar fasciitis, patellar tendonitis(jumper's knee), Achilles tendonitis, etc.....

I'm curious how many folks here suffer from these afflictions.  There's a little bit of research to indicate that it's more prevalent in patients with SLE vs those without lupus. The correlation might be strong enough that some are advocating that enthesitis be considered a good biomarker when potentially diagnosing someone with SLE

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110116420301289

From the article-

In conclusion, clinical and ultrasound-proved enthesitis are frequent in SLE patients. Quadriceps tendon insertion is the most affected enthesis. Clinical enthesitis tends to occur in older SLE patients. GUESS score notably correlated with; age, BMI, and SLEDAI-2K score. BMI and SLEDAI-2K are predictors for increased GUESS score. The presence of enthesitis and the increase in GUESS score may represent a potential marker for SLE disease activity. Enthesis is a target that should not be ignored in the evaluation of patients with SLE.",Links/Articles,0

711,7,"Biopsies confirmed lupus, low ANA, positive schirmertest, etc., but rheumatologist says I’m perfectly healthy. Hi all,

In the beginning of this summer I had multiple skin biopsies and they showed lupus. The dermatologist referred me to a rheumatologist, because of the fevers I’m experiencing since 2006, malar rash that I have since 2015 (the malar rash is confirmed with a biopsy as well), dryness, hair loss, mouth and nose ulcers and many many more symptoms. She thought I have systemic lupus probably and not only skin lupus. 

But the rheumatologist (it was not the first I had seen since 2008) was very rude and dismissive. My blood work showed: low albumin, slightly anemic but normal b12, folic acid and iron and ferritin. Low leukocytes, low positive ANA, sjogren antibodies were not tested with the new test they had. I had high sed rate and normal CRP. The teardrop eye test (schirmer test) was positive. I had 1mm in both eyes, normal range is 10+mm. 

The IGM test was almost too low. Under 0.40 is too low and I had 0.40. 

My urine had leukocytes in it and red blood cells. No bacteria found. 

My blood pressure was high, 150/90. Though normally it was always low and they didn’t check again to confirm the high blood pressure.  

I have swollen ankles and fingers. And raynaud’s, also in summer when temperatures change suddenly from hot to ‘cold’. 

But all these things were fine, said the rheumatologist. He diagnosed me with fibromyalgia. Here in my country in Europe they don’t treat fibromyalgia.. 

About the mouth ulcers he said: “you only get those on the roof of your mouth, so it’s not auto immune. Then you would get them on your lips. And it’s abnormal you only get them on the same place every time.”

About the malar rash he said: “I think it’s sunburn and looks like a malar rash because your wear sunglasses”

The dryness didn’t get addressed either. It’s from my birth control pill he said. He didn’t listen to me telling him I’m only on birth control since two years and the dryness started way before that. 

He also said I look way too healthy to be sick. “You have a perfect figure and weight, you have a nice tan, it’s not sle, enjoy your healthy body”.

I don’t know what to do now. My GP doesn’t want to refer me to another rheumatologist, she says I’m fine and she’s okay with it if I want to talk about it with a psychiatrist. And that I just need to continue applying the creams I got for my skin and avoid the sun. 
She said I’m way to self conscious about my health and I already saw enough specialists since 2008. You never got a diagnosis besides fibromyalgia, so there’s nothing wrong with you. 

There’s only one gp in my area. So I can’t fire her. 

I’m starting to think again that it’s maybe all in my head after all? Or is it maybe worth it to ask my dermatologist for a new referral to another rheumatologist?",Advice,1
712,1,"anyone's mom doing this? I'm 30, my mom is 56. 

After my diagnosis she kept saying i must have got it from her and that she must have lupus because she has joint pains and gets heat flairs time to time.. 

I looked up how much genetic was involved in lupus and it said about 5 percent and that it was rare to pass it on or get it from parents- more likely in siblings? correct me if I'm wrong 

I told her that it wasnt her genes most likely and going through menopause can cause many symptoms but I wanted her to be tested so we could be sure that she didnt have it...  but I do not know why she isnt going through with blood tests...??

Thought y'all might be interested in my experience getting my 3rd covid vaccine.  Here are my basics- diagnosed with Lupus & RA. I'm normally on orencia & plaquenil.

715,5,"Wondering… I’ve been diagnosed with SLE since 2019. Somehow they caught it as it started to develop, I was very, very lucky. Things have been relatively mild as a result with me mostly staying on plaquenil. I did try methotrexate shots with significant increases between October and February. However, it made me too sick and I ended up in the ER a lot. Tried a few other meds, same effect. Finally, now in 2021 towards the end I’m on cellcept. Only mildly sick. 
ANYWAY I’m concerned about something that may involve SLE and kidneys. I’ve been pretty sick for quite some time and the past two? Three? Months I’ve had three-four kidney related urinary tract infections. I’ve never had any problems with my kidneys show up in the bloodwork in the past. Granted it’s been like half a year or something, but still. Also I’ve had pretty significant stomach problems that we are concerned is gastroparesis. Like we had diagnosis down, but now I’m wondering..,could it actually be a lupus/kidney issue?
